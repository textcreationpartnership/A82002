A SOBER and TEMPERATE DISCOURSE, Concerning the Intereſt of Words in Prayer. The juſt Antiquity and HE (who had reported to Maſter Williams, Whittingham, Gilby, and others, that Cranmer Biſhop of Cant
#####Body#####

1. A Diſcourſe of Lyturgies, or Forms of Prayer in Churches, &c.

    _ CHAP. I. The Intereſt of Words in Prayer conſidered, both as to private and publick Prayer; The Neceſſity of them conſidered, as the Homage of our Lips, as they reſtrain mentall extravagancies, and are Interpreters of our Conceptions to others: Conſequences from this Conſideration.

    _ CHAP. II. The Gift of Prayer is partly Natural, partly by Induſtry acquirable. That it is promiſed by God, denied to none that will duely uſe means to attain it; but they may ſo far attain it, as in publick to pray without forms, ſo as God ſhall accept it, and none have juſt cauſe of Scandal. That none worthy of the office of the Miniſtry, need to want it, nor do, but through their own Sin and Negligence.

    _ CHAP. III. The Original of Lyturgical Forms of Prayer. None for 400 years after Chriſt. None impoſed upon any conſiderable Part of the Church, till 800 years after Chriſt, when all manner of Superſtitious Uſages had defiled the Church.

    _ CHAP. IV. An Enquiry into the ſtate of thoſe Churches which firſt commended or impoſed Lyturgies, at the time when they firſt made ſuch Impoſitions.

    _ CHAP. V. Univerſal Conformity of Devotion, as to words and Syllables, no good End. Impoſing Forms of Prayer no reaſonable, juſt or ſufficient Means to prevent Hereſies, or to cure the Lazineſs or Inſufficiency of the Church, proved by Reaſon and by Experience.

    _ CHAP. VI. A particular Examination of the five late Arguments uſed by the Biſhop of Exeter, to evince the Neceſſity or high Expedience of a Lyturgy.

    _ CHAP. VII. Suppoſing Forms of Prayer Lawful, yet every Form is not. What neceſſary, or reaſonable to be found in publick Forms. Doctor Gaudens unhandſom and falſe Repreſentations of Miniſters refuſing to uſe the Common Prayer.

    _ CHAP. VIII. The firſt Reaſon of divers Miniſters not uſing the Common-Prayer. Their diſſatisfaction as to the impoſing of any forms univerſally. Divers reaſons of that diſſatisfaction.

    _ CHAP. IX. The Miniſters ſecond Reaſon, drawn from the diſputableneſs of the lawfulneſs of uſing any Forms of humane compoſure, formerly defiled, by uſe in an idolatrous ſervice, conjoined with the ſcandal of many Chriſtians ariſing upon that account.

    _ CHAP. X. The Miniſters third Reaſon, Becauſe they have ſworn to endeavour a Reformation in worſhip, and to endeavour to Extirpate Superſtition, and what hindereth the power of Godlineſs.

    _ CHAP. XI. Other Reaſons why divers Miniſters are not ſatisfied, as to the Uſe of the Book of Common Prayer.

    _ CHAP. XII. A Summary Recapitulation of the Miniſters Reaſons.

    _ CHAP. XIII. The moſt of Biſhop Gaudens Arguments for the uſe of the Lyturgy, examined, and ſhortly anſwered: Some of them retorted, proving Violentum's in Logick.

    _ CHAP. XIV. Biſhop Gaudens two Arguments, from the Authority of the Church, the influence of Subjects Conformity, in devotion, to their Prince, conſidered. No neceſsity of uſing the Liturgy upon theſe accounts.

    _ CHAP. XV. Biſhop Gaudens Arguments for Church-Muſick examined. The Novelty of Muſick in Churches evinced. Not in the Primitive Church. Not in any Reformed Church Condemned by Aquinas, Eraſmus, and by the Generality of Proteſtant Writers. The Jews no Pattern for Chriſtians in it.

    _ CHAP. XVI. The Biſhops Reaſons for the Engliſh Ceremonies, conſidered. The Churches Power about Ceremonies, examined. No Principle to be maintained to death. Archbiſhop Parkers Opinion of humane Ceremonies. Reaſons againſt them.

    _ A Poſtſcript. Containing a Threefold Supplement to the former Diſcourſes. The firſt, relating to the Chapter about the Antiquity of Liturgies. The Second, to the Argument about Idolatrous Uſages. The Third, to the Argument concerning ſcandalizing of Brethren.
