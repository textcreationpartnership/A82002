            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

remit or intend our minds in all performances, according to the moment of them, and <hi>unfaithful</hi> to that Word, which we own as the ſquare of all our Converſations, if we ſhould not warily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Souls in ſo Sacred an Homage, in which ſo much of our Intereſt lies, not <hi>offering a Female,</hi> when <hi>we have a Male in our Plock</hi>; though we knew of no ſuch Malediction as that, <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord negligently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Whilſt we view this ſacred thing <hi>Prayer,</hi> as our <hi>Priviledge,</hi> we can conſider it no otherwiſe than as a Liberty, to ask of the <hi>Father of mercies, what we or others ſtand in need of,</hi> under the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many precious Promiſes, nor ſhort of his who ſaid, <hi>Ask what thou wilt, even to the half of my Kingdom, I will give it thee</hi>; yea far beyond; for <hi>the Lord will give Grace and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

When we reſpect it as our duty, we find it is expreſſed in Scripture under the many notions of <hi>Seeking God, Calling upon him, wreſtling with him, powring out our ſouls before him,</hi> &amp;c. As our view of it in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a priviledge, forbids us any <hi>limitations,</hi> as to the <hi>matter of our Prayers,</hi> other than what God hath ſet us; ſo the latter obligeth us to a performance of it under ſuch <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> as ſhall neither divert the <hi>intention of our mind,</hi> nor cool the <hi>fervour of our Spirits,</hi> which two things are moſt eſſentially neceſſary to the acceptable perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our duty in it, and ſo excellently becomes that moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred performance; and without which our performance is but <hi>lip-labour,</hi> and <hi>loſt labour</hi>; yea no other than a moſt groſs <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> and <hi>mocking</hi> of him <hi>who cannot be mocked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Prayer being the ſouls <hi>Colloquy with God,</hi> who is <hi>a Spirit,</hi> and our Tongue (which is the Organ of ſpeech) with all the faculty belonging to it, and the iſſues of it, ſerving chiefly (if not only) for <hi>intercourſe with men</hi> (Spirit having another way to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their ſenſe each to other) It is rationally apparent that there is no abſolute neceſſity of any <hi>words at all</hi> in <hi>Prayer. (Haunch</hi> can pray acceptably, and yet her voice not be heard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.) for ſuch neceſſity muſt either be on the <hi>Souls part</hi> or on <hi>Gods</hi>: On the Soul part they are not neceſſary, for it can long and deſire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Tongue</hi>; nor yet on <hi>Gods part</hi> are they ſo, for he not only knows what <hi>things we have need of,</hi> but alſo what we <hi>would have</hi> before <hi>we ask them</hi>; how elſe can he <hi>anſwer</hi> before we <hi>call,</hi> and (as be promiſeth) <hi>hear before we ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. But he who made <hi>all things for himſelf,</hi> did not in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſign except the <hi>Tongue</hi> of man, which being his creature, is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119424:4"/>
naturally obliged, and <hi>ex Inſtitute,</hi> is otherwiſe obliged to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and as his Word hath directed its ſervice in other things, ſo alſo in the duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> commanding us to <hi>take unto us words, and ſay,</hi> &amp;c. And calling to his Spouſe, <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for it is comely</hi>; And his <hi>Providence</hi> hath for this end (amongſt others) diſpoſed reaſonable ſouls into humane bodies, that they ſhould ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the tongues of men to this ſacred Service: Beſides that, <hi>experience</hi> teacheth the Sons of men that the uſe of the <hi>lively voice</hi> is of excellent uſe to <hi>fix the mind,</hi> and to reſtrain that wild thing from ſuch wanton diverſions, as it is moſt prone to, in its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes upon God: Whence it is that there is not only <hi>Mental,</hi> but <hi>Vocal</hi> Prayer, and both the unqueſtionable duty of Chriſtians; and an <hi>uſe of words in Prayer</hi> is, if not at all times, yet at ſome times, and for all Chriſtians, neceſſary by a <hi>neceſſity of Precept,</hi> and highly <hi>expedient</hi> generally even in the Souls <hi>privatest converſes</hi> with God.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But in <hi>Publick Prayer,</hi> the uſe of words is moſt <hi>unqueſtionably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>: God hath not only allowed us a liberty to pray for our ſelves, and in our <hi>Cloſets,</hi> but alſo to <hi>pray one with and for another,</hi> and alſo enjoyned us it as our duty, and encouraged us to it by many gracious Promiſes.

               <p n="7">VII. Nor are the Prayers of the pooreſt Ruſtick (who ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſalutes his neighbour and expreſſeth his mind to him in terms which the Critick cals <hi>Nonſence)</hi> for their <hi>Grammatical incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or defects in Rhetorick,</hi> leſs acceptable unto God than the ſofty ſtrains and luxuriant iſſue of wanton Rhetorick in the prayers of others are, whoſe great ſtudy poſſibly is to put their prayers into handſom Language.

               <p n="8">VIII.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Gift of Prayer is partly Natural, partly by Induſtry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable. That it is promiſed by God, denied to none that will duely uſe means to attain it; but they may ſo far attain it, as in publick to pray without forms, ſo as God ſhall accept it, and none have juſt cauſe of Scandal. That none worthy of the office of the Miniſtry, need to want it, nor do, but through their own Sin and Negligence.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THE <hi>Gift and Grace of Prayer</hi> are two things: The <hi>Grace of Prayer</hi> is a ſpiritual ability in the Soul, from which it is enabled from the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> to go unto God ſaying <hi>Abba,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119424:6"/>
Father,</hi> with an <hi>holy boldneſs, fiducial confidence, fervency of ſpirit, begging of him things according to his Will:</hi> This Nature doth not teach, Induſtry will not neceſſarily bring us to; for this God muſt <hi>ſend forth the ſpirit of his Son into peoples hearts, crying Abba Father,</hi> Gal. 4.6. And none can do this but thoſe <hi>who have received the Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.15. But the <hi>gift of Prayer</hi> is nothing elſe, <hi>but an ability of mind to form words, expreſſive of ſuch deſires of our hearts, as are according to the will of God, conjoyned with a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of memory, and of expreſſion and elocution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Hence it appears, that the gift of Prayer is <hi>partly natural</hi>; for from nature is the faculty of <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Speech</hi>: partly by <hi>Induſtry attainable</hi>; For let us duly conſider, what he hath to do that prayeth, more than to ſpeak (that is in reference to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of Prayer, performable by the gift of Prayer) Prayer conſiſteth of a <hi>Confeſſion of all ſins, Supplications</hi> for ſupply of wants for our ſelves and others, and a <hi>thanksgiving for Mercies received.</hi> Sin is either <hi>Original or Actual:</hi> Actual ſin is <hi>a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God.</hi> This Law of God is contained in his Word; all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations of it in thought, word or deed are ſins. Suppoſing a man in a capacity to <hi>meditate</hi> and <hi>ſpeak</hi> what is wanting to any, ſave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry only, why he ſhould not compoſe a Confeſſion of Sins? If he knows what the Scripture ſaith of the imputed guilt of <hi>Adams ſin,</hi> of our being <hi>conceived in ſin,</hi> and brought forth in <hi>iniquity.</hi> What the Law of God requires and forbids, and conſidereth his own and other mens <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and his own heart, to which other mens hearts anſwer in a great meaſure, why ſhould he not be able to form a Confeſſion in his heart, and (if he have any elocution) to ſpeak it with his Lips? And if he hath any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of knowledge of the Scriptures as to theſe things, why ſhould he not be able to ſpeak this Confeſſion to God <hi>ex tempore,</hi> as well as a <hi>Lawyer</hi> ſhall ſpeak in matter of <hi>Law,</hi> or a <hi>knowing Philoſopher</hi> diſcourſe Philoſophical Learning rationally, many times to the admiration of his Hearers?</p>
               <p>It is further reaſonable, that to a <hi>Confeſſion of ſins,</hi> ſhould be added, an acknowledgment of the Juſtice of God in caſe of any Judgments already brought upon us or others, or upon ſuppoſition if God ſhould bring upon us any. Surely every Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or ſhould know, that <hi>the wages of ſin is death,</hi> that the leaſt ſin expoſeth us to the <hi>wrath of God here and hereafter,</hi> &amp;c. And if he hath a tongue to ſpeak, can ſay ſo to God in Prayer. In the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119424:7"/>
                  <hi>ſupplicatory</hi> part of Prayer, we <hi>deprecate Judgment,</hi> we <hi>implore Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> for our <hi>ſelves,</hi> for <hi>others,</hi> for <hi>ſouls,</hi> for <hi>bodies,</hi> all <hi>according to the Will of God</hi>; whoſo knows he hath a Body and a ſoul, and knows the wants of both, knows what to ask for; and he that knows the Scriptures, is advantaged in that knowledge, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is by them directed, what to ask for <hi>abſolutely,</hi> what <hi>conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> what <hi>Promiſes to urge</hi> upon God in Prayer, what <hi>Judgments</hi> to <hi>deprecate,</hi> and in what <hi>manner</hi>: Nor is any ſo ignorant, as not to know what is good for himſelf or others in a natural ſenſe; the Scripture tels him what is ſo <hi>ſpiritually</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> and if he hath a <hi>tongue,</hi> he can ſurely ſay, <hi>O God, I thank thee for,</hi> &amp;c. Doth he want Expreſſions? The Scripture is full of Expreſſions directive of him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In ſhort, (ſetting <hi>Elocution aſide)</hi> now that the Word of God is in our own Language, there can be nothing but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians horrible neglect of acquainting themſelves with it, or their <hi>non-obſerving</hi> their own hearts, or not uſing themſelves to the <hi>exerciſe of Prayer,</hi> that can hinder any private Chriſtian from being able to ſpeak unto God in Prayer, fully, profitably accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ſo as none but prophane hearts ſhall be ſcandalized. And this Aſſertion is demonſtrable.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8 26. Luke 21. Mark 13.11.</note>IV. Beſides this, God hath promiſed the help of <hi>his Spirit as to words and matter</hi> (in the uſe of means) the <hi>Spirit ſhall teach us what to pray for</hi>; nor is this beneath the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> any more than to give unto ſuffering Saints <hi>what to ſpeak in the very hour they ſhall be called before men for Chriſts ſake</hi>; for which there is a Promiſe, and they allowed therefore to <hi>take no care what to ſpeak before-hand.</hi> We acknowledge that the <hi>Gift of Prayer</hi> is no ſpecial diſtinguiſhing Gift, but a <hi>common Gift</hi>; but by no means can allow our ſelves in the ſuppreſſing of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Hence it is that many a perſon whoſe conſtant employment is not in the work of the Miniſtry, is able to <hi>poure out his ſoul in Prayer</hi> before God, in proper and apt expreſſions, without any further premeditation than is neceſſary, to take the noiſe of his worldly buſineſs out of his head, ſo <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>methodically,</hi> and in ſuch <hi>handſom expreſſions,</hi> that any <hi>godly ſober Divine,</hi> though never ſo <hi>Learned,</hi> ſhall approve his performance, and bleſs God on his behalf.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That any owning the <hi>Name of a Miniſter of the Goſpel,</hi> ſhould not be ſo <hi>able,</hi> is a great reproach to our Church, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119424:7"/>
that this <hi>diſability</hi> muſt proceed, 1. From <hi>a want of knowledge in the Scriptures,</hi> (which every Miniſter ought to know exactly.) Or, 2. From <hi>a want of a due obſervance to, and a watchfulneſs upon his own heart and waies</hi> (whereas he ought to excel others in the practical part of Holineſs) Or, 3. From want of <hi>Elocution</hi> or <hi>freedom of ſpeech,</hi> or ſuch other natural gifts, without which none can judge himſelf called of God to that holy Employment. Or, 4. From <hi>want of exerciſing himſelf in the duty of Prayer</hi>: All which are lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things for any profeſſing himſelf a Miniſter, ſo much as to be ſuſpected of.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Yet that <hi>de facto,</hi> there have been ſuch called by the name of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> amongſt us, and that there are many ſuch amongſt us ſtill, cannot be reaſonably denied: But we dare to aſſert, That all ſuch are either ſuch as for want of <hi>Natural Parts,</hi> are by all <hi>Scriptural Rules</hi> determined inſufficient, and not fit for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, or ſuch, as according to all <hi>Scriptural</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Rules</hi> ought to be removed from the Miniſtry, as neglecting to uſe the Gift of God beſtowed on them, or neglecting to ſtudy the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or ſuch as live in open and known courſes of Debauchery, or finally, ſuch as have ſo uſed themſelves to the lazy Devotion of <hi>Book Prayers,</hi> that they have choaked their abilities, or provoked God in righteous Judgment to deprive them of them.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. It yet remains a moſt <hi>demonſtrable truth,</hi> that the work of Prayer is not ſuch, as to the uſe of words in it, but that any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of any <hi>competent abilities,</hi> (as all Miniſters ought to be) and who is in any reaſonable degree acquainted with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and with any Chriſtian diligence, either obſerveth his <hi>own heart,</hi> or <hi>peoples converſes,</hi> and watcheth over his Flock but with half an eye, may ſo perform, as neither God ſhall be offended with his performance, nor any ſober Auditor ſcandalized and made to <hi>nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate the Duty.</hi> And it will (upon experience) be found impoſſible for any <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> to maintain (by <hi>impoſing Forms of Prayer</hi>) the credit of any Miniſtry, whom the people ſhall diſcern ſo woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglective of their duty, and <hi>defective</hi> in ſo noble a performance, in which they are excelled by the meaneſt of the <hi>Vulgar.</hi> There being no other way (when all is tried) to maintain the Authority of the Miniſtry, than the employment of ſuch, and only ſuch perſons in that work, who ſhall evidently appear to People, as to the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of Gods Spirit beſtowed upon them, to be <hi>taller</hi> by <hi>the Head</hi> and <hi>Shoulders</hi> than thoſe are, over whom God hath ſet

The Popiſh <hi>Maſs-Books</hi> were every where uſed, and long before the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Latine-Service</hi> was univerſal; for to that height of folly was the <hi>Holy Father</hi> come, that he could not think it enough for the <hi>Communion of the Church,</hi> that they ſhould every where pray for the <hi>ſame things,</hi> (which was alwaies done) and in the ſame <hi>words, phraſes and forms</hi> (which he had brought in) unleſs they alſo did it in the ſame language.

The world is grown too wary to believe any thing of this, becauſe any one ſaith ſo; and the Doctor is too wiſe, to undertake to prove this: Let him prove, That <hi>Christ preſcribed the Lords Prayer for a Form,</hi> or <hi>that the Apoſtles ever uſed it ſo.</hi> 2. <hi>Let him prove, that in any of the four firſt Centuries there was any Stated Forms of Prayer uſed in the Church.</hi> 3. <hi>Let him prove, that any Modern Reformed Churches impoſed any Forms of Prayer, ſo that thoſe and no other might be uſed.</hi> And 4, <hi>That they did this after the Pattern of the Ancient Churches from the firſt Century.</hi> All theſe things are to be proved; nor is it poſſible to prove them.</p>

                  <q>It is a Jeſuitical Artifice and back-blow uſed by ſome to aver, though falſely, That the Engliſh Lyturgy was nothing elſe but the Romiſh Miſſal or Maſs-book turned into Engliſh: 'Tis true, he ſaith, ſome things (very ſcriptural) devout and excellent, which the Roman Miſſal had taken, and retained after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Form of Lyturgies of the Church, were ſevered and taken as Wheat from Chaffe, and Jewels from Droſs, by our wiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and preſerved in the Engliſh Lyturgy, conform to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unſpotted Authority.</q> We challenge Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> and all others of his mind, to make this good if they can. It is true, there are ſome things in the Engliſh <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> that are not in the <hi>Gregorian Miſſal.</hi> But let any one take <hi>Miſſale Romanum,</hi> both the old one, and that eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Council of Trent: Breviari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Romanum, Rituale Romanum,</hi> and <hi>Pontificale Romanum.</hi> and compare them all with the printed Com.

If the Reader finds it true, that (whatſoever Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſaith) there is in our <hi>Engliſh Lyturgy,</hi> as it is commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſale, very little but what is to be found in the <hi>Maſs-book</hi> in Latine, let him then go to the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and deſire him (for his credit ſake) to ſhew him thoſe <hi>ancient Forms</hi> of <hi>Lyturgy uſed in the Church,</hi> out of which <hi>theſe Forms of Prayer</hi> were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and <hi>taken,</hi> which muſt be immediately after the firſt <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury</hi>; or tell him, what that ſame <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>unſpotted authority</hi> is, If he tels him, it is Pope <hi>Gregories,</hi> (which he muſt if he ſpeaks truth) let him tell him, that he hath heard, that he was a <hi>vile wretch,</hi> accuſed for a <hi>Murtherer, the Father of most of the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſages now in the Church of Rome,</hi> one who underſtood not the <hi>Greek Tongue,</hi> (as himſelf confeſſeth) a man of no admirable Judgment (witneſs his pretented Commentaries upon <hi>Job,</hi> which might have as well been upon the <hi>Revelation)</hi> a man very far from being either <hi>pious</hi> or <hi>unſpotted,</hi> or fit for his <hi>Seat,</hi> one that defended <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that fawned upon <hi>Phocas</hi> the Murderer; in ſhort, one of no deſerved Name or Authority in the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. By this Diſcourſe it appears, that there was no <hi>Lyturgy</hi> directing Forms of Prayers for the Church, till Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> time <hi>Anno</hi> 600. nor any impoſed till the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, <hi>Anno</hi> 800. when all manner of ſuperſtitious uſages were brought into the Church; nor was it then impoſed without a <hi>Perſecution</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> An Enquiry into the ſtate of thoſe Churches which firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or impoſed Lyturgies, at the time when they firſt made ſuch Impoſitions.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THough it may ſeem abſurd to enquire, whether the <hi>gray hairs</hi> of <hi>Lyturgies</hi> be <hi>found in the way of Righteouſneſs?</hi> when we have evinced, that they have no ſuch pretended <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> and <hi>Age</hi> to glory in, and that the Aſſertors of ſuch Antiquity for them, do but <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the world; yet conſidering what we remember we have learned out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That there is a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in reſpect of <hi>Age,</hi> or in reſpect of <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Conditions.</hi> It may be worthy of a further enquiry, Whether yet there may not be ſuch a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of them, or ſuch a <hi>comlineſs, beauty</hi> and <hi>gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in them, as may not only juſtifie Magiſtrates in the impoſing of them, but oblige every ſoul that hath ought to do with reaſon, to fall in with the uſe of them, yea paſſionately to deſire them (even as much as <hi>Rachel</hi> did children) which we ſhall the better determine, by reviewing the firſt occaſions of <hi>Lyturgies,</hi> and the complexion of the Church in thoſe ages, when they were firſt made, or moſt uſed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I think we may ſay of Lyturgies, as Chriſt ſaid of the <hi>Bill of Divorce,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed; <hi>Moſes verily for the hardneſs of your hearts, gave you a Bill of divorce, but from the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> He that had a <hi>reſidue of Spirit</hi> (as the Prophet ſaith) made <hi>one</hi> for <hi>one.</hi> The Church played <hi>Moſes</hi> his part in the buſineſs of <hi>Forms of Prayer.</hi> Chriſt who had a <hi>reſidue of Spirit, the Spirit given him without meaſure,</hi> impoſed no Forms of <hi>Prayer</hi> upon his Miniſters, or Church. The Apoſtles, who had the firſt and moſt plentiful <hi>powrings out of the Spirit of Grace, impoſed</hi> no ſuch things. Chriſt indeed gave a more general direction to his People in Prayer, to ask things according to <hi>the Will of God,</hi> and in his <hi>Name</hi>; and more particular <hi>directions</hi> in that excellent <hi>Form,</hi> called the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi>; but that (as <hi>Durantus</hi> idly ſaith) either Chriſt, or his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> uſed the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> (ordinarily) as a <hi>Form of words</hi> in Prayer, or that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> uſed a Form of words to expreſs their

                  </gap>r <hi>impoſed</hi> the <hi>Creed</hi> (commonly called, but hardly to be proved) theirs (which the ſame Author aſſerteth) muſt certainly be proved out of ſome ſuch <hi>Canonical Writings,</hi> as the Epiſtles of Chriſt to <hi>Abagarus,</hi> or to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> for there is no authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Record of any ſuch things; but in proceſs of time indeed the Church began to do ſome ſuch things.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The higheſt mention we can find, is, that thin <hi>Synod</hi> of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> made up of 32 <hi>Biſhops</hi>; and this (whatever Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> ſaith according to <hi>Longus</hi>) cannot be proved (as we ſaid before) to have been before the year 364. (as to which time <hi>Balſamon</hi> and <hi>Caranza</hi> agree it) but truly it had been no great wonder if this Church which many years before was grown neither <hi>hot nor cold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.17.</note> but in ſuch a temper, that God was ready to <hi>ſpue it out of his mouth</hi> (for which we have an authentick record in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> ſhould long before this time have made ſuch a <hi>Salve</hi> and prudent Prouiſion for the Lazineſs of her Miniſters: He that ſhall read the <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Synod,</hi> againſt the Miniſters hanting <hi>Taverns,</hi> and uſing <hi>Inchantments</hi>; as alſo the other <hi>Canons</hi> about <hi>exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of the Church, will ſee reaſon enough to conclude, the woful corruption of the Church in thoſe parts, if not to ſuſpect, that it was of a far lower date than is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Synod of 40 <hi>Biſhops</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> (which was the 3d. Synod of <hi>Carthage</hi>) only enjoyned Miniſters to communicate to their more able brethren, <hi>their Prayers compoſed for their publick Congregations</hi>; this was in the year 397. Yet that the face of the Church at this time, had many <hi>ſpots,</hi> and much impurity cleaving to it, may appear by this Synod, by their 6th. <hi>Can.</hi> againſt <hi>giving the Lords Supper</hi> to, or <hi>Baptizing ſuch as were dead</hi>: by their many <hi>Canons,</hi> 17, 25.27. againſt <hi>Clergymen</hi> hanting <hi>Taverns,</hi> and <hi>keeping ſcandalous company with women,</hi> their 30. <hi>Can.</hi> againſt <hi>jovial Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Churches.</hi> their 36 <hi>Can.</hi> about the <hi>Chriſma</hi> or the <hi>anointing Oyl,</hi> which no <hi>Presbyters</hi> muſt make. And that this <hi>Synod</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of the moſt infallibly wiſe Fathers, appears, by their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 29 <hi>Canon</hi>; where they take pains to decree that every Miniſter ſhould give the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar</hi> (ſo it ſeems they had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call the <hi>Lords Supper) faſting.</hi> Yet this Synod in the <hi>buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Prayer,</hi> did not think fit to reſtrain every Miniſter, only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo looſe and inſufficient a <hi>Clergy,</hi> they order the weaker ſort, having compoſed Prayers, to confer their Notes (before they uſed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119424:15"/>
them) <hi>cum fratribus inſtructioribus,</hi> with their more able Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p n="5">V. After this, the Council of <hi>Mela, Anno</hi> 416. grew more bold; and ordain (as to their Province, for what authority had they further?) that the Miniſters ſhould uſe no Prayers, but ſuch as that Synod had approved. They might juſtly expect, that the <hi>Churches</hi> under their inſpection would hardly ſwallow this <hi>new Pill,</hi> if it were not lapped up in ſome good Reaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they give their reaſon for it, <hi>leſt ſomthing ſhould be vented againſt the true Doctrine of Faith, either by ſome Miniſters negligence or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> The cauſe of that <hi>Synods</hi> Meeting, was the cenſuring of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that great enemy of Grace.</p>
               <p>The Errors which <hi>Pelagius</hi> had broached, were theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Adams ſhould have died though he had never ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Infants were born without Original ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That there is no need of he aſſiſting Grace of God</hi> (ſin being once pardoned.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That all the need we have of Grace is, to illuminate us in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That the Grace of God only helpeth us to do his will more eaſily and freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That the words of St. <hi>John, If we ſay we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, were only figuratively true, not literally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>That the Saints praying,</hi> Forgive us our Treſpaſſes, <hi>was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them in the behalf of others, not themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, 8. <hi>If for themſelves, only as an expreſſion of their humility: not concluding them to have any ſins to be forgiven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt theſe Errours that <hi>Reverend Synod</hi> made their 8 firſt <hi>Canons. Pelagius</hi> having uſed diverſe Arts (the ſtory is too long to inſert) to ſecure his Doctrine from a publick Cenſure, had far diffuſed the poyſon of this Doctrine. This <hi>Reverend Synod</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his Errors to be in ſuch things as are the daily matter of Miniſters <hi>Confeſſions</hi> and <hi>Supplications,</hi> thought fit for the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the diffuſing this <hi>Venom</hi> by Miniſters in their publick prayers, as alſo that the Church might have <hi>due confeſſions</hi> made, as well of <hi>Original</hi> ſin as <hi>Actual,</hi> and due <hi>Petitions</hi> put up for <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>aſſiſting Grace,</hi> &amp;c. And conſidering that the church was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched now in her <hi>Clergy,</hi> that ſome through <hi>ignorance</hi> could not do it, ſome through <hi>Lazineſs</hi> would neglect a due care in doing that to which they were able. Others poſſibly (though that be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119424:16"/>
concealed) through a perverſe and <hi>corrupted Judgment,</hi> would not do it, appointed Forms of Prayer to be uſed, and reſtraine the liberty of Praying to the Miniſters within that Province, obliging them to uſe the Forms approved by the <hi>Synod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The reaſon for which (as <hi>Durantus</hi> tels us) <hi>Theodoſius</hi> much about this time, or a little before, ſet St. <hi>Hierom</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>Calendar,</hi> indeed rather than a <hi>Lyturgy</hi> (for <hi>Durantus</hi> ſaith, he did no more than order the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be read, though <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> hath tranſmitted to us an <hi>Antiphonary</hi> and <hi>Sacramental Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> as well as a <hi>Lectionary</hi> of his compoſing) was in regard of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies</hi> riſen up in the Church. So that hitherto, we have had no other account given us of the <hi>compoſing</hi> Forms for publick worſhip, than 1. The <hi>Ignorance of the Ministry</hi> which they were forced to employ. Or 2. Their <hi>Lazineſs</hi> and <hi>Negligence.</hi> Or 3. Their, or the Peoples <hi>falling into Errors.</hi>

               <p n="7">VII. But after that the <hi>Univerſal Biſhop</hi> got up into the Saddle, it was reaſonable that he ſhould have a power of <hi>Univerſal command,</hi> and to ſhew his authority, he muſt impoſe a <hi>compleat Lyturgy</hi> (as to all parts) and enjoyn <hi>univerſal conformity,</hi> which yet he could never obtain, till he got a great Intereſt in the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi>; who had a civil power over what was then almoſt the <hi>univerſal Church.</hi> Nor muſt this ſerve the turn, for this <hi>Univerſal Biſhop</hi> muſt have all Churches, not only ſpeak the ſame <hi>words and phraſes,</hi> but in the ſame <hi>Language</hi> too; hence he brings in <hi>Latine Service.</hi> All which alſo admirably comported with the <hi>ſottiſh ignorance</hi> and <hi>debauchery of the Clergy,</hi> in the 6th. &amp; 7th. <hi>Century,</hi> and ſo downward, till the times of <hi>Reuchlin</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> when Reformation began to dawn, and the light began to ſpring out of darkneſs.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Univerſal Conformity of Devotion, as to words and Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, no good End. Impoſing Forms of Prayer no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, juſt or ſufficient Means to prevent Hereſies, or to cure the Lazineſs or Inſufficiency of the Church, proved by Reaſon and by Experience.</head>
               <p n="1">I. IT cannot but be confeſſed, that it is a <hi>noble end</hi> for any Church to aim at, to take care, that the people may have the truths of God aſſerted to them; and not through the <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>lazineſs,</hi> or <hi>perverſeneſs</hi> of its Miniſters, be ſerved with an Husk in ſtead of bread, or a Scorpion in ſtead of a Fiſh. This end is approveable both from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> of all Chriſtian Reaſon. But that there ſhould be an <hi>Oneneſs</hi> in the <hi>devotion</hi> of people, as to Letters and <hi>Syllables,</hi> and <hi>Phraſes,</hi> and <hi>Forms of Sentences,</hi> is an <hi>end</hi> ſo little, and low and inſignificant in it ſelf, that we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it ſhould be juſtified from Scripture, which indeed ſaith not a word to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And although the prevention of <hi>Errors</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſies,</hi> &amp; the poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of people with them, as alſo the prevention of the miſchief ariſing to the Church from <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>lazy,</hi> or <hi>erroneous Preachers</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> be (as I ſaid before) a <hi>noble end,</hi> and well worthy of the Churches care, yet before we can allow the ſame honour to the impoſing of <hi>Lyturgies</hi> and ſtinted <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> as means in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to thoſe ends, we muſt both enquire, whether they be <hi>lawful means</hi>; and alſo, 2. Whether they be ſuch as <hi>Reaſon</hi> will evince, or <hi>experience</hi> hath proved effectual to the obtaining thoſe ends, and that 3. <hi>Without bringing upon the Church a miſchief every way as great,</hi> as what they are pretended to deliver us from.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That when Chriſt himſelf appointed <hi>no ſtated Forms of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotion</hi> for his Church, to the uſe of which, and no other they ſhould be tied; nor his Apoſtles, though guided by an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit; nor the <hi>Purer Church</hi> for ſome hundred years after, it ſhould remain yet lawful for the Church, not content to repreſs and prevent Errors and Hereſies, by ſuch waies and means as the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119424:17"/>
Apoſtles uſed, but by this new device, to endeavour it, may be juſtly a queſtion to all ſober Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Eſpecially conſidering, that as a <hi>liberty in coming to the Throne of Grace,</hi> and asking there whatſoever we will (provided it be conſonant to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and begged in the <hi>Name of Chriſt)</hi> is one of the great priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt for his Church; ſo the Spirit of <hi>Grace and Supplication</hi> is eminently and frequently promiſed for their aſſiſtance, and that not only to teach them <hi>how to pray,</hi> but <hi>what to pray for,</hi> Rom. 8.26. Nor is this promiſed only to the <hi>Prelates</hi> in a Church, but to every individual Chriſtian; and the <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> whence flows mens abilities to expreſs themſelves by words and phraſes, is one of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts which we are bound to cover, and to improve. All which being conſidered, it is far from being clear, that the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtians, eſpecially of Miniſters in the exerciſe of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gift of Prayer in the publick <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Church, is a lawful <hi>means</hi> in order to any end, it looking like that <hi>quenching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which is forbidden to all men by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. and choaking the <hi>coveting of the beſt gifts,</hi> which is commanded all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. For to what purpoſe ſhould thoſe Talents be <hi>deſired,</hi> which man hath authority to command to be laid up <hi>in a Napkin</hi>? Nay which had far better be laid up <hi>in a Napkin,</hi> than uſed, if the Doctrine of ſome be true, concerning the <hi>tranſcendent excellency of Forms of Prayer,</hi> above what are conceived by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, according to the gift of God beſtowed upon them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Beſides, it may be worthy of enquiry, whether it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or at leaſt ordinary with men to read any <hi>Prayer,</hi> with that fixed and conſtant <hi>intention of mind</hi> and <hi>fervency of ſpirit</hi> (the two neceſſary requiſites of Prayer) as they may ſpeak unto God from the dictate of their own hearts, while their ſouls are more abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from created Objects, than they can poſſibly be, while it is a great piece of their work to look upon their Books, to ſee what to ſay next: For what ſome pretend, that the diverſion is greater in <hi>conceived Prayer,</hi> by the employment of the mind in prompting the tongue what it ſhould ſay next; beſides that this is a ſpiritual employment of the mind within it ſelf, neither doth it require any ſuch ſtudy, where the heart is right with God, and ſo acquainted with the Word and Promiſes of God, as every reaſonable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to be.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:119424:17"/>VI. Nor is it out of the way to conſider whether this method of <hi>Book-praying,</hi> will not expoſe the <hi>Ministers of the Goſpel,</hi> to a perfect contempt amongſt the people, who will certainly conclude their <hi>Parſon</hi> not able to do what every ordinary Chriſtian doth. Of which contempt we have had a plentiful experience, nor do we believe that any thing hath ſo contributed to our breed of <hi>Lay-preachers</hi> as our <hi>Stinted forms of prayer</hi>; Whilſt the people have apprehended their gifts better than their Miniſters, an eaſy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hath ſerved them to uſurp their Office. Nor will any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter longer keep his authority amongſt a knowing people, then by his performances of his Office, they ſhall be convinced he is higher in gifts than themſelves; For rational people will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a blind faith to the <hi>Biſh.</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> magnifying the forms of prayer in the <hi>Common-prayer-book</hi> beyond all meaſure, but will be enquiring, wherein their excellency lies. Are they more perfect Summaries of things to be confeſſed, or to be petitioned for? Is their phraſe more ſcriptural? &amp;c. or if they do ſee an excellency in them, it will be hard to informe them, that the <hi>gift of reading</hi> is more admirable in their Miniſter at Church, then in their ſervant at home.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Now if the <hi>Univerſal impoſing</hi> of any forms upon the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned conſiderations, appear unlawfull of it ſelf, or in regard of ſome neceſſary or certain conſequent, there needs no more be ſaid to prove that men ſhould have made uſe of ſome other means in order to thoſe good ends of preventing errors, and the miſchiefs ariſing, or poſſible to ariſe from a <hi>negligent</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> Miniſtry, to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But ſuppoſe the uſe of this means <hi>lawful,</hi> yet if <hi>Reaſon</hi> might then dictate unto them that applied this means, <hi>That it was never like to effect its end</hi>; and <hi>Experience</hi> hath <hi>ſince taught poſteritie</hi> that upon the experience of 80. years, it hath proved ineffectual, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the very light of Nature ſhould have taught the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, to have uſed ſome other means, and will yet direct us (who have the advantage of experience) in this, to excel out Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. It may put the rational world into a fit of aſtoniſhment to conſider that ſo many <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould think that the impoſing of formes of prayer, would ever contribute any thing to cure the <hi>ignorance or negligence</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> when in very deed, it was the right way to feed both, and to continue theſe ſcabs upon the <hi>Church</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:119424:18"/>
for ever. For a man to be able to compoſe a prayer fit for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, requires no leſſe then a very competent skill in the <hi>whole body of Divinity,</hi> and a very large <hi>knowledge of the Scriptures,</hi> which would have ingaged Miniſters to ſtudy the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and to ſtir up their gifts. But when they had once thus provided for them, there needed no more skil for a Parſon, then every ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had, <hi>viz.</hi> an ability to read the written prayers. It is true, they had yet ſome work to do in <hi>preaching,</hi> but this was ſoon taken off their ſhoulders, by adding ſtill formes of prayer, the reading of which ſhould require ſuch a length of time, that no roome was left for Sermons, or it there were, <hi>Homilies</hi> came quickly after, which would ſerve the turn: So that theſe impoſed <hi>Liturgies,</hi> in ſtead of ſerving their end, in curing the <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>negligence</hi> of Miniſt<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, did moſt wretchedly ſerve to fill the Church, with <hi>ignorant and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy perſons</hi> yea and debaucht too, for now the Miniſters work was ready, and he might ſtay at the Ale-houſe till Saturday, and yet be as fit for his work, or at leaſt do as much the next day, as was required of him, which was not only miſerably exemplified in the <hi>Popiſh Church</hi> (til <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his time and the beginnings of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when they began by the Proteſtants oppoſition to be quickened to a little better attendance to their work) but is at this day ſufficiently evident, as to the generality of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to ſay nothing of the liberal experience of it, which our own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath afforded.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Nor certainly could juſt reaſon dictate it a proper or adequate means to prevent, or reſtrain Errors and Hereſies: for how ſhould this ever do it? ſhall preaching by a <hi>form impoſed</hi> be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to praying? or ſhall there be <hi>forms of prayer</hi> impoſed for the Pulpit as well as the Desk? Theſe certainly had been too groſſe impoſitions. If not; had not the Miniſters as much liberty to vent their Errors in their Pulpit-prayers, as they would have had in the Desk? or in their Sermons as in their prayers? But then people would have apprehended, they ſay, that they vented their own conceits, not the doctrine of the Church? And would they not far better have apprehended this, if the Miniſter had only been enjoyned to read a perfect <hi>Syſteme of the doctrine of Faith ſummarily</hi> drawn up. (Such was the wiſdome of the <hi>Councel of Nice</hi> in the caſe, though indeed that <hi>Creed</hi> be far from a <hi>perfect Syſteme</hi>) This no ſober Miniſter would have ſcrupled. Beſides <hi>Hereſies</hi> are commonly the iſſue of <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> and experience hath told the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119424:18"/>
world that nothing ever ſo contributed to the breeding of <hi>Schiſmes</hi> in the Church, as <hi>impoſed formes of prayer</hi> have done: So contrary hath it appeared to the <hi>Senſus communis</hi> of Chriſtians in all times, <hi>that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be reſtrained in the gift of prayer,</hi> I ſay in all times ſince the <hi>Reformation of the Church,</hi> nor would the <hi>Popiſh Church</hi> have ever been able to have impoſed theirs ſo long upon the people, if beſides that <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> which alwaies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> is commands in caſe of diſobedience; they had not wiſely kept the people from the ſight of the Scriptures, or from the hearing of any Sermons (almoſt:) For nothing but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ignorance, could have ſecured this <hi>devotion</hi> ſo long. And no ſooner came the light of knowledge amongſt the people, but many of them either ſaw, or thought they ſaw, that this kind of <hi>Praying</hi> was not all that God required of his Miniſters. And in thoſe Churches where were <hi>forms of prayer</hi> (though tranſlated into an intelligible tongue) there were continual <hi>Factions</hi> and <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from that which they called the Church, and more in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> then elſe-where, becauſe no reformed Church had ſuch a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> nor ſo impoſed.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. But ſuppoſe the impoſing formes of prayer lawfull, and that it had effected its end, done ſomething to prevent <hi>Errors</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and ſome <hi>miſchiefes</hi> which from the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> of Miniſters might have come upon the Church. If yet the <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> coming by the <hi>means</hi> uſed hath been, or is like to be as great, as that which they are deſigned to prevent, (or though not ſo great) if there be other <hi>more proper and regular means</hi> (not ſubject to the ſame ill conſequences) and more certain to obtain the end which may be uſed, certainly all prudent men, will conclude that, theſe old ineffectual miſchievous means, ſhould be no longer uſed, but thoſe far better applyed.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The miſchiefs which the <hi>impoſing forms of prayer</hi> have brought upon the Church, have been, 1. The <hi>nurſing</hi> up of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>lazy Clergy,</hi> not giving themſelves to <hi>medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> (two of thoſe things which <hi>Luther</hi> thought neceſſary to make a <hi>Divine</hi>) 2. <hi>Separation from Church Aſſemblies.</hi> 3. Dreadful <hi>Perſecutions</hi> upon <hi>Godly Miniſters and people,</hi> who could not judg their <hi>conformity</hi> lawful. The Admirers of theſe forms perſwading Princes to eſtabliſh them by their civill authority, and then ſuggeſting to them, that the Miniſters and peoples not complying with them, was out of a principle of diſloyalty to their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119424:19"/>
                  <hi>Princes,</hi> and diſaffection to their authority, and bringing <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi> under the crime of <hi>Laeſa Magiſtatis,</hi> evils certainly not much leſſe, then what <hi>Impoſed forms</hi> were pretended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Yet were the continued uſe of theſe means in order to ſuch ends more tolerable, if there were no other to be found moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly juſtifiable, far more regular, and more effectual, as to the end. Would the <hi>Prelates of the Church</hi> prevent the riſe and growth of errors &amp; hereſies by the Miniſters <hi>negligence, ignorance,</hi> or <hi>perverted Judgement</hi>? Let them, 1 Take care, that none be admitted into the <hi>Miniſteral Office</hi> or truſted with the charg of Souls, but ſuch as ſhal be throughly examin'd, as to their knowledg in the body of <hi>Divinity,</hi> &amp; of whoſe gift in prayer, they ſhal have taken an <hi>Experiment,</hi> and who ſhal not firſt by ſome open Act declare his <hi>Aſſent</hi> to the <hi>doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Faith.</hi> May they not withſtanding this be lazy? or afterwards perverted in judgement? To what purpoſe ſerve <hi>Synods, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryes,</hi> &amp;c. But to take a conſtant account of the Miniſters of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pariſhes? how they uſe their gifts? diſcharge their Office? to admoniſh, the irregular, ſuſpend, deprive them, &amp;c. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as this means is more proper and more regular, more rational for the obtaining the aforeſaid ends, ſo the uſe of it would be far more effectual, and all good people would be ſatisfied, and rejoyce in it.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. From this diſcourſe it appears, that the pretended <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a <hi>Liturgy</hi> or <hi>impoſed forms</hi> of prayer in any Church, is no other then ſuch as the author of <hi>Diſcoliminium</hi> told us merrily, <hi>Von Doſme</hi> conceived there was, when the fire burnt his Shins, <hi>that the Chimny ſhould be pulled down and ſet farther off,</hi> when it had been more eaſy, and every whit as effectual for him to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Shins from the fire; yea ſuch as (the ſame author tels us) was the <hi>neceſſity</hi> which <hi>Simon</hi> the French Monk ſaw, that the poor people of a <hi>Province of France</hi> were under (wanting cloathes) to <hi>flea themſelves and ſend their Skins to be tanned,</hi> that they might have cloathes for their backs, when as they eaſily ſaw, the remedy would be as bad as the diſeaſe. In very deed there can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the neceſſitie of <hi>impoſed forms</hi> of prayer, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any of the Ends aforeſaid, of which aſſertion we have a demonſtration both in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other reformed Churches, where there is no ſuch impoſed <hi>Liturgies,</hi> though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119424:19"/>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> A particular Examination of the five late Arguments uſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> to evince the Neceſſity or high Expedience of a Lyturgy.</head>
               <p n="1">I. VVE have hitherto conſidered whatſoever Antiquity could pretend for the uſefulneſs of impoſed Forms of Prayer in the Church, and weighed them in the Ballance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;<note place="margin">Conſd <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> but the <hi>Reverend</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> improves the notion of their uſefulneſs higher, telling us, <hi>they have very many great, and good influence, upon true Religion and upon every Church</hi>; which he endeavoureth to make good in five Inſtances, which we ſhall crave leave modeſtly to examine.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Firſt, He ſaith, <hi>It conduceth much to the more ſolemn, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and auguſt and reverent worſhip of the Divine Majeſty, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Congregations, where otherwiſe the moſt Sacred and venerable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries muſt be expoſed to that rudeneſs and unpreparedneſs, that barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119424:20"/>
and ſuperficialneſs, that defect and deformity, both in matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, judgment and expreſſion, to which every private Minister is daily ſubject, as late experience hath taught us.</hi> It will be very hard to find any thing in this more then words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will be granted, that the publick Service of God ought to be performed <hi>ſolemnly, reverently</hi> and <hi>compleatly</hi>; for that ſame <hi>auguſt ſerving of God,</hi> we do not well underſtand the Doctors meaning; if he means <hi>outward Pomp</hi> and <hi>Splendor,</hi> in the habits of thoſe that ſerve at the Altar, or lofty high flown phraſes, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words of vanity, we never read that God either required it, or delighted in it, nor can we from any reaſon conclude the neceſſity of it or uſefulneſs of it, as being contrary to all the Copies of Prayers and Sermons ſet us by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, and no way ſuted to the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>plainneſs</hi> of the Goſpel-Devotion: God is unqueſtionably then ſerved moſt <hi>reverently</hi> and <hi>ſolemnly,</hi> when the worſhippers of him approach him with moſt fear, and worſhip him with moſt affection and <hi>fervency of ſpirit,</hi> wreſtling with God, (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did) which the Prophet interprets by <hi>weeping and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Supplications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, that Miniſter ſins, who (though <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>negligence)</hi> expreſſeth any want of <hi>Reverence of God</hi> in his heart, by <hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>rude expreſſions,</hi> (not fitting to be uſed in civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men) or which may make the Service of God contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that <hi>every miniſter</hi> muſt needs be thus guilty, (with the Doctors leave) <hi>experience</hi> hath not taught us, and is very uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably and falſly aſſerted. We have not (bleſſed be God) ſuch a pitiful Church, that there are no Miniſters in it, but are liable to the charge of ſerving God in Prayer with <hi>rudeneſs, unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, barreneſs, ſuperficiality, defect, deformity,</hi> and that both in <hi>matter, manner, judgment</hi> and <hi>expreſſion.</hi> No Jeſuit ever had the confidence ſo to aſperſe the Miniſtry of <hi>England,</hi> nor could ſpeak more ſordidly to their diſhonour. Poſſibly there may be ſome, (and there have been far more than now are) who may be too lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this charge. But where's the fault? Is it not in thoſe to whom the truſt is committed of taking a due cogniſance of ſuch as offer themſelves to be <hi>ordained,</hi> or admitted to the cure of ſouls? Should not they take care to admit none, but ſuch as are both able to preach and to pray? Do they not diſcharge their work conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly, while they admit ſuch as are not able to pray, without
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119424:20"/>
ſuch rudeneſs as is here complained of? or make no more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, than to do it <hi>unpreparedly, ſuperficially,</hi> with ſo much <hi>barrenneſs, defect</hi> and <hi>deformity?</hi> ſuch as neither have <hi>judgment</hi> to compoſe a Prayer, as to matter, nor <hi>elocution</hi> to pray, as to <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> ſo, but that people ſhall have juſt cauſe to <hi>nauſeate</hi> the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Doctor means (by his phraſe of <hi>every Minister being ſubject,</hi> &amp;c.) only that 'tis poſſible that the beſt Miniſters may ſo be negligent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to run upon this Rock, that is as true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>reading Prayers</hi>: none will deny, but he that can read very well, may <hi>read falſe,</hi> and if he keeps not his mind intent, no doubt but he will perform the Service, as <hi>rudely</hi> and <hi>ſuperficially</hi> by <hi>reading,</hi> as by <hi>ſpeaking</hi>; Inſtances might be given of this, and ſhall if need be: And certainly the conceiving of a Prayer will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand more attention of mind, than reading can. All therefore ſaid under this Head, is meer air.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But Secondly, He tels us, <hi>That a Lyturgy is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to preſerve the truth of Christian and Reformed Doctrine, by the conſonancy of publick Devotions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>into which otherwiſe corrupt minds are apt to infuſe the ſour Leaven of their own corrupt Opinions.</hi> Fine words again! But what reaſon? we have before ſhewed it to be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſtionable, whether a lawful means or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If lawful, by no means effectual,</hi> except it reach to all Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preaching too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not the <hi>only means,</hi> a good Summary of Chriſtian Faith is far more proper and rational.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A means bringing a miſchief as bad as what it pretends to cure,</hi> yea far worſe, fit for nothing but to breed rents and ſeparations, the mothers of all Hereſies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. An <hi>Apochryphal means</hi> by which men make themſelves wiſer than Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or the Purer Church. We ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propound this Queſtion upon this ſuggeſtion: If this be true, how comes it to paſs, that all the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Popiſhly affected Clergy-men</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are ſuch Zealots for a lyturgy? The thing is demonſtrably true, that it is ſo; let the Doctor anſwer this Queſtion by his next.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But Thirdly, A <hi>Lyturgy</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is neceſſary for the holy Harmony and ſweet communion of all Chriſtians, as well in National, as Parochial Churches, whilſt thereby they are all kept in one mind and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119424:21"/>
Spirit, praying the ſame things, and chearfully ſaying</hi> Amen <hi>to the ſame Praiſes and Petitions.</hi> Here is the old Fallacy ſtill of <hi>Verba elegancia, pro ſenſu ſimplici,</hi> That all Chriſtians have the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wants, and ought to pray for the ſame things in the main, is to be granted, though as particular perſons, ſo particular Churches may have renewing wants, not common to all (for which a <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> will not ſerve the turn) But is there any ſo ſimple, as not to underſtand, that the <hi>ſame things</hi> may <hi>be prayed for in different words and phraſes?</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> here miſtook his Mark, he ſhould have proved, that it is <hi>the Will of God that Chriſtians ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Communion in the uſe of the ſame phraſes, letters and ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi> And when he had done that, a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt</hi> ſhould have improved his Notion, and concluded that becauſe the <hi>one body of Chriſt</hi> ſhould have but <hi>one tongue,</hi> and ſince the <hi>confuſion at Babel,</hi> men in ſeveral nations have ſpoke ſeveral languages; therefore to the perfection of the <hi>Communion of the Church,</hi> there is not only a <hi>Liturgy neceſſary,</hi> but a <hi>Liturgy</hi> every where in <hi>Latine,</hi> that being a Language moſt univerſally known. The Churches external Communion lyes in their <hi>keeping the ſame Sabbath, performing the ſame Acts of worſhip</hi> (of which prayer is one) confeſſion of <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Actual ſins, praying for the ſame mercies generally,</hi> &amp;c. not in their ſaying all the ſame words ſure.</p>
               <p>He tells us (fourthly) <hi>That a Liturgical form is not onely of great benefit, and comfort to the more knowing, judicious, and well-bred ſort of Chriſtians, but highly to their ſecurity, and to the holy and humble compoſure of their ſpirit in the worſhip of God, who otherwiſe are prone not onely amidſt the publique devotions curiouſly to cenſure, but ſcoffingly to deſpiſe,</hi> (By the way this is no Demonſtration, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Chriſtianity, nor of their good breeding) <hi>yea many times to laugh at, and at beſt to pity, or deplore, the evident defects and incongruities which appear in many Miniſters odd expreſſions, and incongruous wayes of officiating,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To reduce theſe many words to a ſhort ſum of reaſon, the uſefulneſs of <hi>impoſed Liturgies</hi> is here pleaded. 1. <hi>For the benefit of the moſt knowing, judicious, and well-bred ſort of Chriſtians.</hi> 2. To <hi>avoid</hi> the <hi>cenſures, ſcoffs, and jears of others.</hi> The Dr. hath not yet told us what benefit accrues to the former from a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> nor yet what ſolid grounds of <hi>comfort</hi> for them to feed upon, the want of which it may be is the reaſon, that if others gueſs rightly, that take all the profeſſors of Religion that can but give any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119424:21"/>
account of the Syſteme of Divinity, and live in any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety of life and converſation, and number them (taking their judgment as you go along) and in will be found, that ten for one are againſt any impoſed Forms: On the other ſide, it is certain, that ſome others make it all their Religion: So it was of old. That Holy and Learned <hi>Oeculampadius</hi> living in a Noble mans houſe, who yet was a Proteſtant, and would ſeem a forward man in the Reformation, complains of the ſlender regard the greateſt part of the Family gave to him, and to his Miniſtry, in a Letter to his Friend in theſe words, <q>Such a man (ſaith he) ſent for me, that I might publickly in the Church inſtruct his Family in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, or rather feed them with the words of Chriſt, who were initiated already. I counted it my chief duty to make the Evangelical Law known familiar at hand to them, that ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they might of themſelves proceed in the true and ſincere ſtudy of Chriſtianity, Peace, Meekneſs, Modeſty, Charity, Piety, Faith and Confidence in God. All the time of <hi>Lent</hi> that I was there, nothing hindred, but that I might every day read a piece of the Goſpel to them, and expound it, and exhort them out of it to the ſtudy of Godlineſs: But after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> it was leſs conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; for the Family was not at-leiſure to ſpend much time at Church, their buſineſs did ſo call upon them; and there are ſome that are ſick of the Church, if they tarry there never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while. <hi>pieri<expan>

               <p n="5">V. But it ſeems this Maſter of our <hi>Lyturgical Feaſt</hi> hath kept his <hi>best wine till the laſt,</hi> for he tels us, that a <hi>Lyturgy</hi> is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or conduceth at leaſt mightily—<hi>above all—to the edification and ſalvation, as well as the unanimity and peace of the meaneſt ſort of People. Salvation and Edification</hi> in order to it, are great things, ſo alſo are <hi>unanimity</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and doubtleſs by all juſt and lawful means to be endeavoured: But how ſhall a Lyturgy conduce to theſe? Certainly the Captain of our Salvation hath directed the beſt and moſt proper means for the <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> of ſouls, and we need not deviſe other than what he hath appointed; yet did he never inſtitute a <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> nor the Apoſtles after him. He tels us, That a daily variety of <hi>Expreſſions in Prayer or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is much at one</hi> (to the Vulgar) with <hi>Latin Service, little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,</hi>

                  <hi>and leſs remembred by them; they are ſtill out, and to ſeek, when a new Miniſter officiates, yea and when the ſame, if he affects va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety ef words, where the duty is the ſame.</hi> For the peoples remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, it were worth the while to examine the Vulgar people, where a <hi>Liturgy</hi> is conſtantly uſed, how much they remember of it? If the Doctor would do this, he might poſſibly be convinced, that a <hi>Lyturgy</hi> is not ſuch an <hi>effectual means</hi> to imprint <hi>Divinity no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in peoples memories. As to the <hi>peoples underſtanding,</hi> the reading of the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> ſignifies as little; if the furious Zealots for <hi>Lyturgies</hi> amongſt the Vulgar, were examined of their ſenſe of the <hi>ſeveral phraſes,</hi> they would make a wild Interpretation. It is not the uſing of a <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> will bring people to ſuch an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Body of Divinity</hi> as is neceſſary to him that would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a good Prayer (whether it be a ſtinted Form, or no) but their underſtanding of a good Catechiſme to be wrought in them by a frequent exerciſe of <hi>Catechizing</hi>; and when they once underſtand the Principles of Religion, they will eaſily underſtand a Prayer, (though they do not alwaies hear the ſame words) where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter doth not affect a vanity and ſingularity of phraſe; which if he doth, the <hi>Governors of the Church</hi> ought to reſtrain him, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and other Cenſures. This is the way to make people underſtand Prayers, (whether the Phraſe be the ſame, or diverſe) provided it be not phantaſtick and vain. By this it appears, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath ſaid nothing to convince the world of any neceſſity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119424:22"/>
of <hi>impoſed Forms,</hi> nor yet of any <hi>expediency</hi> in them. We have before offered enough againſt them, ſo that thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken of <hi>Impoſed Forms</hi> in the general.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Suppoſing Forms of Prayer Lawful, yet every Form is not. What neceſſary, or reaſonable to be found in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Forms. Doctor <hi>Gaudens</hi> unhandſom and falſe Repreſentations of Miniſters refuſing to uſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer.</head>
               <p n="1">I. FRom our former Diſcourſe, every intelligent Reader will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conclude, that we have neither aſſerted it unlawful to compoſe a <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> nor yet to <hi>uſe it,</hi> either in <hi>private</hi> or <hi>publick,</hi> no nor yet to <hi>impoſe</hi> it upon ſome: All that we have que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, is the lawfulneſs of impoſing <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> upon all <hi>Miniſters</hi>; as well thoſe whoſe gifts are eminently known, and their diligence and conſcience in that duty ſufficiently experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as thoſe who either through <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Lazineſs</hi> are not fit to be truſted, without ſuch a guide in the publick ſervice of God. Nor do we think it impoſſible that a Miniſter of eminent gifts, through ſome bodily, or ſpiritual diſtemper, may poſſibly be ſo out of courſe, that he may lawfully enough help himſelf with a Form: but becauſe a <hi>Staffe</hi> may be uſeful for an <hi>old withered body,</hi> and for a vegete and lively body, that hath accidentally got ſome <hi>Vertigo</hi> in his head, or wound in his foot, it will nor therefore follow, that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that it be enacted, that none ſhould walk without it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But certainly in reaſon, thoſe Forms which ſhould be either publickly or privately uſed, <hi>ſhould be ſuch rare Patterns of Prayer, as might juſtly commend themſelves to all ears,</hi> as containing full <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of ſin Original and Actual,</hi> full Petitions for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal Mercies,</hi> for our ſelves and others, as alſo <hi>proportionable Thanksgivings,</hi> and all theſe expreſſed in Scripture phraſes, ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and couched, that the hearers may be convinced, that there is nothing contrary to the Will of God in them, nor any momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous thing, by <hi>Gods Will</hi> allowed us to ask, which is omitted. It
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119424:23"/>
is alſo reaſonable, that ſuch Forms ſhould be ſo worded, ſo every way circumſtantiated, that no ſober ear could be offended at them, all conſcientious Chriſtians might ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to them, and if any ſhould be needful to plead their cauſe, he might have more to ſay, than that jejune commendation, <hi>Nothing can be ſaid againſt them but may be anſwered, nor found in them but what is capable of a very good ſenſe.</hi> Theſe are lamentable commendations for <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> to be <hi>impoſed upon a Church,</hi> full of holy, learned and godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People, who cannot be cheated into a blind Belief, That <hi>they are the beſt,</hi> becauſe ſuch a man ſaid ſo. <hi>And no private Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt preſume to rate his private abilities above the Shekel of the Sanctuary:</hi> From whence will eaſily be concluded, that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it lawful to uſe <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> in <hi>publick,</hi> yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is lawful to <hi>uſe every Form</hi> that ſhall or may be tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, but ſuch only as for matter, manner and circumſtances, ſhall appear to us agreeable to the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We ſay, 1. It muſt appear to us that the <hi>matter of thoſe Prayers be ſuch as Gods Word allowes us to ask of him</hi>; otherwiſe we ask not <hi>according to his Will.</hi> 2. That the <hi>mode and manner</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſcribed, be ſuch as Gods Word alloweth, either by expreſs Letter of Scripture, or juſt conſequent. 3. That no <hi>appendant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance</hi> make the uſe of them unlawful, which as to the matter and manner are lawful enough. For none is ſo ignorant, as not to know that in matters of practiſe a thing may <hi>ex accidenti</hi> be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which is not ſo <hi>per ſe,</hi> or of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This now bringeth us from our general Diſcourſe concerning the lawfulneſs or expedience of any Forms, to a more particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the particular Forms of Prayer in the <hi>Engliſh Lyturgy,</hi> according to the Copies now printed and ſold: (For what thoſe were that were eſtabliſhed by Acts of Parliament we cannot tell) and therefore muſt reſtrain our Diſcourſe to that <hi>Engliſh Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> only, which is ordinarily to be had in Stationers ſhops, and at adventures from thence tranſmitted to many Churches.</p>
               <p n="5">V. And we cannot but take our ſelves concerned a little to ſpeak in this caſe, when the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> thinks fit to brand all thoſe Miniſters that are willing to accept his <hi>Majeſties</hi> moſt Gracious Indulgence, and to forbear the uſe of the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as alſo all thoſe ſober perſons, that are not ſo fond as his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of it, with <hi>reſtiveneſs, inexcuſable moroſeneſs,</hi> an <hi>antilyturgical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, peeviſhneſs, ingratitude, ſchiſmatical petulancy, pride,</hi> ſuch as only

fancy they could mend ſome <hi>words &amp; phraſes</hi> in it, or put <hi>ſome Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſes</hi> to it, ſuch as <hi>ſacrifice their judgments to their Credits,</hi> yea, and (he had almoſt ſaid) <hi>Conſciences</hi> too; ſuch as <hi>ſtand in need of it to help</hi> their <hi>frequent infirmities,</hi> reſtrain their <hi>popular and deſultory levity,</hi> to ſet bounds of <hi>Diſcretion, Decency, Charity and Piety to their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies:</hi> and brands their powrings out of their ſouls to God, (without the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi>) with the ugly Notions of <hi>flat, dull and undevout, deadly tedious, of a confuſed length, like a Skain of Yarn courſe and ſnarled, ſomtimes ſo dubious, between wind and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſence and Nonſence, faction and ſedition, boldneſs and blaſphemy,</hi> &amp;c. Is it not time when this Gentleman thinks not fit to ſpeak all this, with much more ſuch ſtuffe, in the <hi>Syriack Tongue,</hi> but upon the walls, in the face of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh tongue,</hi> to make ſome reply, to let both him and the world know, That though we have not ſo learned Chriſt, as to render <hi>reviling</hi> for <hi>reviling,</hi> nor dare pretend to an ability to give the <hi>Biſhop</hi> word for word of this nature, but ſhall willingly allow him <hi>proeſtaſie</hi> in that Art and Practiſe; yet we do humbly conceive our ſelves able to give ſome reaſons of our preſent forbearance, which may poſſibly be judged <hi>good and ſufficient,</hi> if the Reformed Churches my be our Judges, and not ſuch of our Brethren at home, whoſe only deſire is to have an occaſion againſt us, and know not how to find it, in thoſe things which concern the Worſhip of our God.</p>

               <p n="1">I. IT is not clear unto us that it is lawful for <hi>all persons,</hi> and <hi>at all times</hi> to <hi>limit themſelves</hi> by any <hi>ſtinted forms of prayer.</hi> Where God hath given a gift of prayer to his Miniſters, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think it is their duty to improve, and uſe it, if indeed God hath denied that gift unto any, or by his providence any way hindereth the exerciſe of it, we (as was ſaid before) do not doubt but ſuch perſons, or any perſons at ſuch times, may help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a form;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7.</note> but where God hath given any that gift, we conceive <hi>it is a manifeſtation of the Spirit given him to profit others by.</hi> and that he is defective to his duty, that doth not uſe it to that end; we are yet to learn, that it is not as lawful to impoſe <hi>forms of Sermons</hi> upon Miniſters, as forms of prayer; both of them, are lamentable reſtraints put upon the gifts of God beſtowed upon his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119424:24"/>
Miniſters, to that very end, that by the uſe of them they might be profitable unto his people.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We are ſure it is the <hi>unquestionable duty</hi> of every one that prayeth, to do it with <hi>the higheſt intention of mind imaginable, and with the greateſt fervency of Spirit,</hi> and that it is not lawful for any man in prayer, to allow himſelf in any thing, which may either divert his mind, from the moſt <hi>fixed contemplation of God,</hi> or <hi>intention upon his duty,</hi> or which may any way cool the <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>fervency of his Spirit.</hi> We cannot be induced to believe that any one can poſſibly ſo keep his ſoul <hi>fixed upon God,</hi> or <hi>ſo intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God</hi> whiles he <hi>reads a Prayer,</hi> as while he <hi>ſpeaks</hi> it from his own conception; we find by experience (not to determine poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of the frame of other perſons Spirits) a great difference in the intention and fervency in our Spirits, when our words in prayer are directed, and determined, by the <hi>inward heat, fervency, and affection of our hearts,</hi> from what is, when our words are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for us, by other men, yea by our ſelves before the time of prayer, vve humbly conceive, that every Chriſtian ſtands bound, not onely to look that there be an habit of fervency in his heart, vvhich at all times ſhould diſpoſe it to duties of communion with God, but that a particular fervency ſhould attend the <hi>act of Prayer</hi>; If we durſt boaſt of the former, yet we find the latter certainly hindered by a preſcribed form, and we do believe this may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by any perſon's ſpeaking to a man for his life; vve do not think it poſſible for any man to have, or ſhew the like <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> in <hi>reading a Speech</hi> which another hath made for him, no not in what he hath made for himſelf, before that time; as he may by ſuch words as the preſent ſenſe of his condition in that moment of time ſhall dictate to him: nor have we ever heard of <hi>any malefactor</hi> at the bar that brought his Speech for his life in a form, if he did, we believe there was (even by the hearers) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned a vaſt difference betwixt ſuch ſpeeches, and ſuch as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpeaks at that time, to whom a lively ſence of his condition, dictates words in that hour.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Nor can we believe, that any Miniſter praying in any form <hi>uſeth ſo rational, and experimented a means to affect his hearers hearts, as he who uſeth none.</hi> As in preaching there is a certain lively effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the voice which every hearer diſcerneth, more in the Preachers ſpeaking <hi>ex animo,</hi> then from his <hi>reading a Sermon,</hi> which is paſt denial evidenced, though it be not ſo eaſie to ſay what it is.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119424:25"/>
So that a Sermon, yea an <hi>ordinary Oration</hi> ſo ſpoke, moves and affects the hearers, infinitely more, then a <hi>Sermon,</hi> or an <hi>Oration</hi> read out of a paper (though it be never ſo well ſtarcht up with <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and ſet out with the higheſt advantage of an <hi>Oratorial</hi> read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tongue) ſo we believe, and find it in the matter of prayer; and in very deed, the reaſon of this we conceive lyeth much in this, becauſe the Speaker himſelf is (diſcernably) not ſo much affected in <hi>reading,</hi> as in <hi>ſpeaking.</hi> 'Tis one thing for the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to precede the action of the tongue, and to ſee it on work; another thing, for them to follow the tongue, and be commanded by it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Speaking is an immediate act of the Tongue, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Soul; the Tongue is but the Souls Organ, by which it exerciſeth that power vvhich God hath given it, and it cannot be ſo well performed, as when the Soul that directs, performs its work by dictating immediately to it. So that much of the Spirit and life of prayer is loſt, in praying by forms.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Nay laſtly (to add no more) if there were nothing elſe in the caſe, we ſhould think it very diſputable, <hi>Whether it be lawful for us in the publique worſhip of God, eſpecially as to the momentous acts, and parts of it, to do that for which we have no command in the Word of God, no preſident, or example,</hi> and we cannot but think, that the holy <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> variety of prayers, and the variety of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which we find uſed by the ſeveral Saints, and holy pen-men of Scripture (none of which as to words and phraſes agrees <hi>per omnia</hi> with another) ſhould rather teach us, that when we go unto God in prayer (obſerving the general rules of prayer laid down in the Scripture) we ſhould take unto us words <hi>de novo,</hi> as God ſhall put them into our hearts, then borrow words from others, hardly fitted to our hearts, or preſent neceſſities. If any have not ability to do it, we conceive it is his own fault, and it were far more conſonant to the rule of Gods Word, that ſuch ſhould be removed from Gods Altar, then that the gifts of God beſtowed upon others for the benefit of his Church, ſhould be reſtrained for their ſake, which we think would be ſomething like his act, who cut the man fit for the bed, becauſe the bed way not fit for him. Certainly in all congruity of reaſon, if the Church be <hi>peſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and muſt needs continue ſo, with a generation of men, who either through ignorance, or through a wofull neglect to <hi>ſtir up the gift of God</hi> in <hi>them,</hi> cannot pray without a book, and for their ſake,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119424:25"/>
a <hi>Liturgy.</hi> or <hi>ſtinted forms in prayer</hi> be neceſſary, yet from hence cannot be concluded any <hi>lawfulneſs,</hi> much leſs <hi>neceſſity,</hi> that thoſe, to whom God hath given other abilities, and another ſpirit, ſhould be obliged to uſe it, or that it ſhould be impoſed upon them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The Miniſters ſecond Reaſon, drawn from the diſputableneſs of the lawfulneſs of uſing any Forms of humane compoſure, formerly defiled, by uſe in an idolatrous ſervice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with the ſcandal of many Chriſtians ariſing upon that account.</head>
               <p n="1">I. BUt ſuppoſe we were ſatisfied, that it were lawful for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel to uſe <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> and that at all times, and that this were no ſtifling of the gift of prayer, no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to <hi>the intention of our minds,</hi> nor <hi>abatement to the fervor of our ſpirits,</hi> nor <hi>to the affections of our people</hi> (to do any thing apertly tending to any of which, is ſimply unlawful) yet there are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſons which appear to us cogent enough, as to the reſtraint of us from the uſing of this form.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We cannot but have ſome doubts <hi>whether it be lawful for us in the worſhip of God by an act of ours to offer up any thing to God</hi> (of meer humane compoſition) <hi>which hath been once offered in an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous ſervice,</hi> eſpecially when our Brethren <hi>ſay unto us, This hath been ſo offered</hi>; That the worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is idolatrous, groſly idolatrous, vve hope no ſober <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will deny, their <hi>Veneration of Images, Adoration of the Eucharists, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints</hi> are all idolatries. Some of theſe are done as oft as their <hi>Maſs-book</hi> is uſed; ſo that their vvorſhip, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> as it is performed, is <hi>idolatrous,</hi> though not in every part, yet in the <hi>complex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. We do obſerve how ſome <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> mince this point of <hi>the Idolatry of the Church of Rome,</hi> they can grant (vvith much ado, vve believe) <hi>that the worſhip of the Church of Rome is in ſome ſenſe idolatrous</hi>; what their ſenſe is vve cannot tell, nor care to inquire, vve believe, that, except ſome few <hi>Pagans</hi> vvho might <hi>terminatively</hi> vvorſhip the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> as thinking thoſe noble
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119424:26"/>
Creatures vvere the very <hi>first movers</hi> and <hi>principles,</hi> That never any heathens vvere guilty of more <hi>ſtupid ſottiſh idolary,</hi> then the <hi>Papists</hi> are. For (let vain perſons talk vvhat they pleaſe) it vvill never enter into our thoughts that either the <hi>Jews, Jeroboam,</hi> or <hi>Michal,</hi> thought their Images the firſt principles of life and being, (ſuch as reaſon teacheth to all that God muſt be) nor yet that the Egyptians,
<q>
                     <l>— quibus naſcebantur in hortis</l>
                     <l>— Numinae.</l>
                  </q>
(vvho vvorſhipped any plants, or any thing, from vvhich they had good or hurt) thought that thoſe things vvere God. They onely dreamt that God vvas <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> the Soul of the World, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming every living thing, and vvorſhipped an <hi>unknown God</hi> in the creature, or by ſome created repreſentation, (vvhich is yet groſs and accurſed idolatry) and ſuch is the Popiſh vvorſhip.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. VVe are not ſo filly, as to think, that the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> (dictated by the Spirit of God) or any thing elſe of <hi>purely Divine Inſtitution,</hi> is capable of corruptions, and therefore cannot but vvith ſome laughter read the argumentations of them, vvho argue, that if vve reject the <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V. Dr. Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> on the Lords prayer.</note> becauſe the idolatrous Papiſts uſed it, vve muſt alſo refuſe the Scriptures, and the Lords Prayer; theſe are but toyes, to blind common people, vvho cannot ſee to the bottom of an Argument. The holy Scriptures are incapable of pollution by any idolatrous ſervice.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Their anſwer is as filly, vvho tell us, that then vve muſt uſe none of our <hi>Churches.</hi> VVhen vve offer up <hi>Churches to God</hi> by any <hi>rational act</hi> vve vvill conſider of this frivolous anſwer, vvhich indeed may concern them that dream of a holineſs in them, by reaſon of <hi>dedication</hi> or the like: it concerns not us, vvho onely uſe them as convenient places, in vvhich vve meet to ſerve God, and believe them no more holy then any other places, though the Law of Nature obligeth us to keep, and uſe them decently. VVe do ſo by our parlours vvhere we converſe vvith our friends.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Prayer is a piece of Goſpel Sacrifice, and by a rational act of our ſouls to be offered unto God, now vvhether it be lawful for us, vvhen <hi>the earth is the Lord and fulneſs thereof,</hi> vvhereas God hath given us an ability, to ſpeak vvords in another form; to take thoſe very forms, and to offer them up to God in true Goſpel vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, vvhich have been <hi>offered</hi> in an <hi>idolatrous ſervice</hi> (though
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119424:26"/>
the matter of thoſe forms be not idolatrous) is to us a great doubt, nor can vve be ſatisfied in the lawfulneſs of it.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The ground of our ſcruple is in that known Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. where the Apoſtle treateth concerning the lawfulneſs of eating meats, that had been once offered to <hi>idols.</hi> He determines as to a double caſe. 1. <hi>That it is not lawful to eat ſuch meats in an idols Temple.</hi> 2. In caſe it be ſold <hi>in the ſhambles,</hi> and we know it not, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, that we may <hi>buy and eat it.</hi> But in caſe <hi>our Brother ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, this hath been offered to an idol,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Eat it not.</hi> So that our Brethrens ſcandal upon ſuch a foundation is to be avoided by us, he gives the reaſon, becauſe there is <hi>other meat to eat. The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. For our part, we are not able to fathom a reaſon, why a <hi>form of words fitted up for uſe in prayer,</hi> ſhould not be liable to the ſame corruption, and pollution that a <hi>diſh of meat</hi> fitted for <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe is</hi>: or why it ſhould be unlawful for one to eat the latter, (if once offered in an idolatrous ſervice, our Brother minding us of it) and it yet be lawful to uſe a form of words in prayer (ſo formerly uſed) when our Brother is ſo ſcandalized.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. We are aware of what the <hi>Drs.</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> ſaid of old to prove that the <hi>ſcandal of brethren, weighs light, when put in the ſcale with the command of Authority.</hi> There may ſomething be ſaid for their <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> where the ſcandal is meerly <hi>paſſive,</hi> and hath no foundation <hi>in re,</hi> only men are offended, becauſe they are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but where the ſcandal is ſuch, as is ſo far allowed by Scripture, that a <hi>Negative precept</hi> is given upon it, <hi>eat it not,</hi> we are not of ſo eaſie a faith, as to believe what they ſay, when Gods word ſaith <hi>do it not.</hi> Man cannot oblige our conſcience to do it, he may oblige us to ſuffer, but not to act; and that this is the caſe is evident. Our Brethren ſay to us, <hi>Theſe Forms have been offered up in an idolatrous ſervice,</hi> and we know this is truth.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The <hi>Biſhop of Exeter</hi> is miſtaken therefore in ſuggeſting, that we forbear the uſing of the <hi>Liturgy out of a little point of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, amongſt ſome people (rather weak then wiſe, and to be pitied more then imitated,</hi> and he ſhews little <hi>charity,</hi> or <hi>candor</hi> in ſaying we ſacrifice our <hi>judgements</hi> (not to ſay our <hi>conſciences</hi>) to <hi>our credits,</hi> and <hi>out of a fear or lothneſs to offend ſome people, whom we might eaſily convince and ſatisfie as well by our examples, as by arguments, &amp;c.</hi> This is not ſpoken like a tender and a good Chriſtian. We hope we can ſay, we value our reputation at a low rate in compariſon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119424:27"/>
of our duty. Nor do we think <hi>non-conformity</hi> the <hi>way to credit</hi> now, but that our peoples ſouls (of which we confeſs we are tender) are <hi>more weak then wiſe,</hi> we cannot ſay. Wiſdom lies in avoiding ſin, yea the leaſt ſin, and <hi>all appearances of evil.</hi> That here is <hi>an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil</hi> no reaſonable perſon can deny, it is not ſo clear that we may do that as to <hi>forms of prayer,</hi> which the word expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us <hi>as to a piece of meat,</hi> not is it ſo clear to us, that we may <hi>obey man</hi> in any caſe, where the Word of God ſaith as to the thing commanded, <hi>Do it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. In the mean time we think thoſe <hi>are to be pitied,</hi> who had rather that their brethren ſhould be all <hi>perſecuted, impriſoned, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,</hi> together with thoſe <hi>thouſands</hi> of godly people, (who cannot in conſcience worſhip God <hi>with theſe forms</hi>) differences in the Church perpetuated, and that ſo many thouſands of ſober people, ſhould have ſuch a temptation, to entertain hard thoughts of their Magiſtrate, &amp;c. In ſhort who had rather confound <hi>heaven and earth,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalize all Chriſtians</hi> in the world, then lay aſide <hi>forms of prayer</hi> of pure humane compoſition, and that in moſt corrupt times, and only retained upon the <hi>reformation</hi> to quiet peoples ſpirits, and which (in their own confeſſion) have for 6. or 700 years before the reformation, run through the filthy ſink of the <hi>Romiſh Synagogue.</hi> When God hath himſelf told them, <hi>That the earth is his, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> And therefore expreſly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us not to uſe a piece of meat once offered to idols, when our brother tells us it hath been ſo polluted.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But it may be ſome of our Fathers, or Brethren (what ever a company of us <hi>Puritans</hi> do) do not think the Church of <hi>Rome an idolatrous Church,</hi> nor her worſhip <hi>idolatrous,</hi> we have heard of diverſe that have lately queſtioned it. We confeſs for thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that are of that mind, our Argument upon this head ſignifies little to them, but we are of another mind in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and therefore 'tis no wonder we have different thoughts of the Conſequents. In the mean time, thoſe who believe the Church of <hi>Rome idolatrous,</hi> have reaſon to think of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Thoſe who judge her yet an <hi>undefiled Virgin,</hi> we ſuppoſe may have a deſire to be married to her. And we ſhall hardly be able to forbid the banes.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. VVhen the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> can ſatisfie us, That the <hi>worſhip of the Church of Rome in the whole Complex is not idolatrous,</hi> Or that it is lawful for us, <hi>to take forms of prayer of meer humane
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119424:27"/>
compoſition ſo uſed in an idolatrous ſervice, and yet continue them in the true worſhip of God.</hi> Gods VVord ſaying to us, as to <hi>meat</hi> ſo uſed, <hi>Eat it not.</hi> Or that it is lawful for us to tell our people (when they come and tell us, Sirs, <hi>They ſay this is taken out of the Maſs-book,</hi> will you uſe it?) <hi>No brethren 'tis not taken out there,</hi> when we know it is. I ſay, when his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> can ſatisfie us in theſe things, he may then conclude (which as yet he doth very uncharitably) <hi>That we might eaſily convince and ſatisfie our people, as well by our Examples as Arguments.</hi> Our people are a plain kind of Country people, that are not to be ſatisfied with a <hi>flaunt tant</hi> of high words, they have their Bibles, and having ſo plain a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by the end as that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Eat it not,</hi> they choke us with ſuch things as theſe. Is not the <hi>Romiſh Church Idolatrous? have not they uſed the ſame forms in their idolatrous devotion? how can you then uſe them without ſin?</hi> So that we profeſs we cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them. We deſire the <hi>Biſhop of Exeter</hi> would do it <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>ſolidly.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Miniſters third Reaſon, Becauſe they have ſworn to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a Reformation in worſhip, and to endeavour to Extirpate Superſtition, and what hindereth the power of Godlineſs.</head>
               <p n="1">I. BUt further yet to let the <hi>Biſhop</hi> know, that it is not out of a meer <hi>Anti-Liturgical humour</hi> that ſome of us (taking the advantage of his Majeſties Declaration, and laying hold of his Grace and Favour in it) do not yet meddle with the Book of <hi>Common-prayer.</hi> VVe deſire his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to conſider, <hi>That we have taken the Covenant,</hi> and are afraid to bring upon us that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which we are ſure firſt or laſt will follow perjury. If his Lordſhips <hi>looſing St. Peters bands,</hi> could have looſed our <hi>Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> from that, we had been a ſtep nearer then we are, but we obſerve no truth of Divinity in the <hi>Principles,</hi> which his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and others, have laid down; from which they would conclude, that the bond of that <hi>Covenant</hi> is diſſolved; we alſo diſcern, his Lordſhip, and the others abundantly anſwered by Mr. <hi>Crofton,</hi> and <hi>Timorcus,</hi> and could wiſh that when any of them write again upon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119424:28"/>
that Subject, they would not onely aſſert poſitions, but give their reaſons which may evince the truth of them, or elſe annex ſome Scriptures to prove them; or at leaſt tell us, what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines were ever of their mind.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We have in the Covenant ſworn to endeavour a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of God in England, in worſhip according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches.</hi> VVe think the <hi>worſhip of God in England,</hi> is, as to the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the <hi>Common-prayer Book,</hi> and the <hi>Forms of devotion</hi> there expreſſed and impoſed: We cannot find that either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or the <hi>example of the beſt Reformed Churches,</hi> it is lawful for the Miniſters of the Goſpel to tye up themſelves to <hi>forms of prayer,</hi> nor that ſuch practiſe is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us: nor can we conceive how the uſe of <hi>the ſame forms of Worſhip</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Reformation in Worſhip.</hi> Nor (poſſibly) is it clear to every one, that there is nothing in thoſe forms of worſhip ſavouring of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> or that the uſe of them is conſiſtent <hi>with</hi> the promoving of the <hi>power of Godlineſs</hi>; at leaſt, that it is a due means to promove it, all which we have ſolemnly ſworn to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi>; and ſurely that <hi>indeavouring</hi> to which we are ſworn, will at leaſt oblige us not to do any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Into which <hi>Covenant</hi> many Miniſters of the Goſpel having entred, ſince they uſed the ſaid forms of prayer; ſomething may be ſaid on their behalf, diſobliging them from a return to their former practice, though in theſe laſt 20 years time they have learn'd nothing from the many books publiſhed to the world, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſaid <hi>forms in ſpecial,</hi> of offering arguments againſt <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forms</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> convincing them of a former in adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and error in practice. If they then looked upon the uſe of thoſe forms as <hi>indifferent,</hi> ſurely the <hi>Oath</hi> they have taken puts it into another capacity. If they now judge the <hi>uſe unlawful,</hi> (it is no great wonder conſidering how much light hath ſhone upon the world in that ſpace of time, that ſome of their judgements ſhould be altered) the <hi>Biſhops</hi> charge of <hi>Schiſmatical petulancy,</hi> reſtiveneſs, moroſity, &amp;c. cleaves not to them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſayes they had before ſubſcribed to uſe it: According to his <hi>Lordſhips</hi> doctrine, and ſome others of his mind, <hi>forced ingagements</hi> ſignifie nothing. It is true the Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>England</hi> are of another mind, they believe, though they were <hi>under a force,</hi> (either they muſt ſubſcribe, or looſe their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119424:28"/>
livelyhoods, yea looſe the exerciſe of their Miniſtry) yet they are obliged by their Act, in caſe it doth not appear to them, <hi>That it is ſinful for them to do what they inadviſedly ſet their hands to</hi>; but that is the Caſe. Beſides, though they cannot think that any Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power can diſcharge them of an Oath made to God, yet they believe that the <hi>Parliament of England</hi> can diſcharge them of an Engagement entred to an inferiour <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and by Oath again bind them to do the contrary; and that's the caſe again.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If any ſay, <hi>That the Miniſters of England are bound by the Law of England to uſe the Common-prayer Book.</hi> Beſides that it is a great queſtion how far the Laws of a Nation can oblige the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in matters of Divine VVorſhip, and moſt certain, that they cannot oblige any mans conſcience, to do any thing in the worſhip of God, that is, either directly, or by conſequence forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there, we make it a great queſtion whether the Common-prayer Book be eſtabliſhed by <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> and believe the contrary. That the <hi>Common-prayer</hi> Book 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. with ſome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. was ſo eſtabliſhed we know, but what that book was, or where it is, we cannot tell; it is apparent that the books ordinarily walking up and down are not ſo eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Suppoſe it were, we do not think that this is pleadable in the Caſe, againſt the <hi>Covenant</hi> agreed by <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally aſſembled in Parliament, and ſo far ratified by the King, as unqueſtionably in conſcience would ſuffice to diſcharge any that ſhall keep it; (though contrary to ſome former <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Nor can it enter into our thoughts, that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or any power under Heaven, can by any future Act, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge us from the obligation of an Oath; for out parts, thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> that talk any ſuch things, ſeem to us little acquainted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the vvord of God, or with the nature of an Oath. Not with the former, for God expreſly <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. determines the Oath <hi>eſtabliſhed for ever,</hi> if the husband of the wife, or father of the child, either at firſt conſented, or did not preſently diſſent but hold his peace; nor with the latter, for all Divines determine it, in the power of men to ingage men in an Oath to God, but not in their power to diſcharge them again, becauſe the Oath makes us debtors to God, and it belongs to God alone to diſcharge us; which eſpecially holds, where the matter of the Oath is ſuch as Gods Law required, and for which an Oath is onely a ſecurity,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119424:29"/>
and certainly ſuch is the matter of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the rooting out of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and the promoving the <hi>power of Godlineſs.</hi> The Powers of the world in ſuch a caſe may contract guilt to themſelves by forcing ſuch as fear an Oath, to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> becauſe they durſt not violate their <hi>Oath</hi>; but they can never lay hold on mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by any Act of that nature, ſo as to make them ſinners, if they do not <hi>actively obey</hi>: Nay it is far better in ſuch caſes, and in all caſes, to <hi>obey God</hi> rather <hi>than men.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Other Reaſons why divers Miniſters are not ſatisfied, as to the Uſe of the Book of Common Prayer.</head>
               <p n="1">I. CErtainly in reaſon, if a <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> or Form of Prayer be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to any Church, it ſhould be ſuch a well compoſed and compleatly digeſted Pattern of Prayer, as ſhould contain in it the ſum of all things to be ordinarily <hi>confeſſed,</hi> or <hi>begged,</hi> or for which <hi>thanks ſhould be given</hi>; and this drawn up, in ſuch plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as ſhould be obvious to every hearer, and yet ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly, as ſhould reconcile the hearers reverence and attention to it. The <hi>Confeſſion</hi> ſhould be of the guilt of all <hi>Original ſin,</hi> as well <hi>originans</hi> as <hi>originatum</hi>; the guilt of <hi>Actual ſins.</hi> The <hi>Petitionary part</hi> ſhould conſiſt of <hi>Petitions,</hi> for a <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of ſin, <hi>Faith, Juſtification, a ſenſe</hi> of it, <hi>Regeneration,</hi> &amp;c. And all theſe ſhould be in ſuch a form, as no Hearer ſhould have a reaſonable excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Thus we are ſure it would beſt fit two (if not the only) ends for which there can be any pretence of the neceſſity of a Lyturgy. 1. The <hi>acquainting of people with the Doctrine of the Church,</hi> as to things neceſſary to be believed, and the <hi>prevention of Errours.</hi> 2. <hi>The helping the weakneſs of ill accompliſhed Divines,</hi> who are not able <hi>ex tempore</hi> ſo to pray in a Congregation, by which means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly their people never hear a juſt <hi>Confeſſion of ſins,</hi> nor put up perfect Supplications.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now it is poſſible that if the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> (who hath indeed a rare art at words) may have liberty to comment upon our <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> he may prove, that ſuch as underſtand as much as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119424:29"/>
himſelf, may from our <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> fancy ſuch a perfection of Form, and by Arguments and far-fetched conſequences, make out all theſe; but ſurely none can ſay, that take the <hi>ordinary Prayers</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read every <hi>Morning Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Evening Prayer,</hi> they do contain all things requiſite to be <hi>confeſſed</hi> or <hi>petitioned</hi> for, in ſo plain and familiar expreſſions, that ordinary people can underſtand, that in thoſe Prayers we confeſs the guilt of <hi>Adams ſin, Original ſin,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>petition</hi> for ſuch things as are abſolutely neceſſary: Nay we believe that if they did, ſome that are great <hi>Zealots</hi> for the uſe of them, would not ſo well like them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Beſides that the <hi>matter of ſome things</hi> in the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> is not in our judgments ſo approvable; we do not underſtand with what truth we can ſay to God <hi>eight daies together</hi> that he ſent his Son to redeem us, [<hi>as on that day</hi>] nor yet as to any one particular day. Nor yet how we can pray in Faith to be delivered from <hi>Lightning, Tempeſts</hi> and <hi>ſudden death</hi>; we underſtand how we may pray in Faith to be delivered <hi>from the evil of theſe temporal judgments,</hi> and from the judgments themſelves <hi>(if it be the Lords Will,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
               <p n="5">V. We by experience find, that the <hi>Form</hi> of the Service pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the <hi>Engliſh Lyturgy,</hi> is ſuch to which the <hi>Spirits</hi> of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber people are no waies <hi>reconcileable</hi>; who cannot underſtand what foundation is either in Scripture or right reaſon, for the uſing <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prayers</hi> for <hi>each day,</hi> or dividing the <hi>entire Service of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Miniſters and People,</hi> or for uſing ſo many <hi>ſhreds,</hi> or <hi>ends of Prayer,</hi> or repeating the <hi>Lords Prayer ſo often.</hi> Nor can we our ſelves be more ſatisfied with it. Mr. <hi>Sparrowes Rationale</hi> in this caſe to us ſeems to have as little reaſon in it as <hi>Durantus</hi> his <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale</hi> hath for all the ſuperſtitious uſages of the idolatrous Synagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <q>—Et canpare pares, &amp; reſpondere parati.</q>
Neither of the Barrels have in it better Herrings.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Now for us (being ſo graciouſly indulged by his Majeſty) to <hi>ſcandalize all thoſe people</hi> whom we muſt ſcandalize, ſeemeth to us not lawful, conſidering how tender St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of <hi>giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> to brethren (how light a matter ſoever be now made of it) eſpecially conſidering the obſervation which we make, which we cannot ſay is univerſally true, but as to our Congregations is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true, and that is this; That many of the perſons offended at
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119424:30"/>
our forbearance of the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> are not of the <hi>ſtricter,</hi> but the <hi>looſer ſort of Profeſſors,</hi> ſuch as his <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath juſtly ſtigmatized in his <hi>Proclamation,</hi> as <hi>vicious, prophane</hi> and <hi>debaucht perſons, Drunkards, Tavern-haunters, Health-drinkers, Swearers,</hi> not that they are all ſuch, but ten for one we find to be ſuch; and we as generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That thoſe of our Pariſhioners, who fear an <hi>Oath,</hi> who live <hi>chaſtly, temperately</hi> and <hi>ſoberly,</hi> and <hi>by any Rule,</hi> are generally not deſirous of the uſe of the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> where they have a Miniſter of any abilities: But where we have any perſons, that give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtrict exerciſes of Religion, that <hi>pray in their Families, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves in the Scripture,</hi> and have <hi>any great knowledge of them,</hi> we find them generally impatient of it: Now we cannot think it lawful for us, to ſcandalize the far greater number of ſtrict Chriſtians, that we may gratifie a few others, in whoſe lives we find nothing, but what is a far juſter ſcandal to all good men, than a godly Miniſters forbearing the uſe of the <hi>Lyturgy</hi> can be to them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Eſpecially alſo conſidering, that we ſee, that that ſort of people who are ſo zealous for the Lyturgy, ſo dote upon it, that it is clearly become their <hi>Idol,</hi> they think there is no ſerving of God without it, no need of any ſerving of God but <hi>with it:</hi> With many people we ſee it demonſtrably true, that if a Miniſter ſhould never preach the Word of God, yet if he did but read the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> it would be enough. The Preacher makes their heads to ake. Now we cannot judge it lawful for us upon this view of the ſtate of our people, to nurſe them up in theſe conceits, which are hardly Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Yet it might go far with us, if one of fourty of thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are ſo fond of the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> could but give us a reaſonable account, why they deſire we ſhould pray by <hi>Forms,</hi> rather than <hi>without,</hi> why by <hi>theſe Forms</hi> rather than others. VVe do not think it lawful for us to ſatisfie the irrational humours of people, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our light.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. By all this, the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> may ſee, that we have ſomthing to ſay for our ſelves, why we do not uſe the <hi>Lyturgy</hi>: Not to enter into a particular examination of the parts of it, the woful Tranſlations of Scripture in it, the <hi>irrational cutting of verſes</hi> from verſes, Chapters from Chapters, with 1000 other things, would we examine it in parts, which hath been already done by many: We profeſſ our ſelves for theſe Reaſons to forbear it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119424:30"/>
and to judge our ſelves obliged in conſcience to forbear it. VVe acknowledge it in his <hi>Majesties</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us for that forbearance: If they ſhall think ſit to inflict any puniſhment in that caſe, we acknowledge it our duty to ſuffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, comitting our ſouls unto God as to a faithful Creator: In the mean time, we are humbly thankful to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,</hi> that <hi>none of us ſhall be puniſhed for the not uſing of it,</hi> (at leaſt not for a time.) VVe do not forbear becauſe his <hi>Majeſty</hi> gives us leave, but we forbear out of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and bleſs God, who hath put it into the heart of his Moſt Excellent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to forbear <hi>puniſhing</hi> of us for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> as to his <hi>matter of our God.</hi> It is therefore a ſpiteful &amp; odious repreſentation, which Biſh. <hi>Gauden</hi> hath made of us, which hath no foundation of <hi>Truth,</hi> nor <hi>mixture of Charity.</hi> God grant him better Interpreters of his Actions, and requite him not according to his dealing with his Brethren, who deſire to <hi>fear the ſame God</hi> which he profeſſeth to worſhip, and to walk by the ſame Rule which he profeſſeth to own. <hi>Happy is he that condemneth not himſelf in what he allows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall ſhut up this Diſcourſe with a ſummary Recapitulation of what Reaſon are ſcattered in the preceding Sheets, juſtifying our Practiſe in the forbearance of the uſe of the Common Prayer.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> A Summary Recapitulation of the Miniſters Reaſons.</head>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>VVE cannot believe that it is lawful for all of us, at all times, by limiting our selves to a Form of Prayer,</hi> to ſmother the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> given (we hope) to ſome of us, or to <hi>cool the heat and fervency of our hearts in Prayer,</hi> or the <hi>Affections of them that hear us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Becauſe we <hi>can find no Precept for it is Gods Word, no Pattern of it there,</hi> but one (<hi>pretended) Form,</hi> that made by Chriſt himſelf, although we doubt whether ever it were intended for a <hi>Form of Prayer or no,</hi> and rather think it a direction for the matter of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; one <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſaying no more, than <hi>after this manner,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles leaving no Record of their uſing of it; my few of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119424:31"/>
the <hi>entire phraſes</hi> in it to be found in other Scriptures. (Dr. <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabon</hi> in his late Book, is miſerably put to it to parallel the <hi>phraſes</hi> of it, as any indifferent Reader will judge) yet it being holy Scripture, we doubt not but we may uſe it in the Form, which is ſo ſhort, as we may eaſily get it by heart, and not employ our ſouls (at our eyes in reading) while they ſhould he wreſtling with God: And the divine authority of it is ſuch, as it hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of influence on our Spirits in uſing (as all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath) than can he pretended for any other Forms: And by the length of it, we eaſily underſtand, that it was never intended to be uſed without any other Prayer, to ſay nothing of many other Arguments might be uſed for that.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Becauſe we cannot find, that <hi>there was ever any Forms of Prayer uſed in the Church, in any part of it till</hi> 400 <hi>years (or very nigh) after Chriſt,</hi> nor any made (for more than ſome ſingle Province) till 600 years, and then by that ſuperſtitious wretch Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and not impoſed till 800 years after Chriſt, when all manner of Corruption was brought in; and we challenge all our Adverſaries, to prove what they ſay to the contrary of this in any Chriſtian Church: For what Dr. <hi>Cauſabon</hi> ſaith, of Forms of Prayer uſed by the Heathens to their Idols, and by the Jews in their moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, depraved eſtate, it deſerves no Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Becauſe we cannot <hi>imagine any uſe at all of them, or any good they ever did, especially when impoſed.</hi> They were firſt invented to cure the <hi>negligent</hi> and <hi>ignorant Clergy,</hi> to prevent <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi>; we have ſhewed, that in ſtead of this, they have made an ignorant and negligent Clergy, that they are neither a ſcriptural, nor rational means to prevent Hereſie, that they have been the Mothers of <hi>Hereſies,</hi> cauſing <hi>ſeparations,</hi> and conſtantly brought forth dreadful <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> and will do ſo ſtill in reaſon.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Becauſe we canot <hi>think it lawful in the worſhip of God, to uſe forms of Prayer</hi> (which are compounds made by men) which have once been offered in an Idolatrous Service (ſuch as is that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) Dr. <hi>Cauſabon</hi> ſaith nothing, in telling us, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are in the Maſs-Book, they are no humane Compoſitions, nor capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of defilement. Though in theſe Forms there be no Idolatry, yet they have been uſed in a <hi>Service groſſely Idolatrous.</hi> There the Queſtion lies; not <hi>whether we may uſe nothing which hath been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Idols, or in an Idolatrous Service?</hi> That's a Foppery to dream: but, <hi>Whether it be lawful for Christians in the ſpiritual Worſhip of God,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119424:31"/>
by a rational act of theirs, in devotion to offer up what is of pure humane compoſition, and ſo may be altered, and which hath been before defiled, by being offered in an Idolatrous Service abhorred of God.</hi> Let our Brethren ſpeak to this Queſtion, and leave ſpeaking to other things, as our uſing the ſame <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Temples</hi>: For the latter, they know ſo did the Primitive Churches, which yet never uſed the <hi>Pagan</hi> Forms of words. This is not to ſpeak <hi>ad idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Becauſe we have <hi>ſworn to endeavour a Reformation in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and the <hi>extirpation of Superſtition,</hi> and what is contrary to, or may <hi>hinder the power of Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. Becauſe of the <hi>infinite ſcandal which we muſt give to ſome of our Brethren that durst not uſe it,</hi> and to <hi>thouſands of our moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, holy, ſtrictly living Christians</hi>; and we durſt not offend <hi>thoſe little ones,</hi> though we dare leave our Miniſtry, if Authority will command one or the other.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Becauſe we ſee <hi>the number of thoſe who are judicious, ſober Chriſtians who deſire it, is very ſmall,</hi> but the generality of thoſe given up to all manner of looſeneſs, prophaneſs, and debauchery, are impatient for it, and reſt in it, ('tis as the Papiſts Beads to them) and they care for no other worſhip of God, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it far from our duty, to harden any in what we know is their ſin and wickedneſs.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Becauſe we are aſſured in our Conſciences, <hi>that very many of thoſe in our ordinary Congregations who are earneſt for it, preſs the uſe of it, upon no other account,</hi> than <hi>from a Principle of malice againſt godly Miniſters and People,</hi> and deſire it for nothing elſe, but that they may have a weapon to deſtroy all religious perſons by; this is evident by experience, when ſome Miniſters have uſed ſome part, they are yet as zealous to turn them out, finding fault, they do not read all; then, he doth not wear the Surplice; he doth not pray the <hi>Canon Prayer</hi>; he doth not ſay <hi>later Service.</hi> Nor can we get of them any reaſon why they deſire we ſhould uſe it, only 'tis <hi>eſtabliſhed by Law,</hi> (which we cannot believe) If it were, we think in matters of Gods worſhip ſomthing elſe muſt be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Becauſe the <hi>Forms</hi> appear to us very ſhort of a perfect <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Prayer,</hi> full of <hi>obſolete words, dubious</hi> phraſes, <hi>antique</hi> reſponds, and ſuch a <hi>Method</hi> (through the whole) as is like to none in any <hi>Reformed Church</hi> in the world, nor any where to be <hi>parallel'd,</hi> but in the <hi>Roman Miſſal,</hi> nor any way ſuited to the <hi>ſpirits of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>

               <p n="1">I. DR. <hi>Gauden</hi> hath ſo perplexed his Diſcourſe with words, and been ſo careleſs of Method, that we have found it no eaſie thing to pick out his Arguments; we could have wiſhed, that like a <hi>Logician</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> he had propoſed his Arguments ſtrictly, and followed them cloſely, that we might have judged that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was with a <hi>ſtrength of Argument,</hi> in the <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> to <hi>convince</hi> us, over whom he ſo <hi>provocatively,</hi> inſults, not meerly to confound his <hi>Reader</hi> with a <hi>non-ſignificant Rhodomantado</hi> of Phraſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. So far as we can gather, he one while argues for a <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> by and by for <hi>this Lyturgy,</hi> and no other; for which he one while argues, from the <hi>Obligation of the Law,</hi> another while, from the Obligation of the <hi>Example of the Primitive Churches,</hi> or of ſome <hi>Perſons now living</hi>: By and by he urgeth the uſe of it from <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to his Majeſty,</hi> and from the contrary Evidence of <hi>Ingratitude, Moroſity, Peeviſhneſs,</hi> &amp;c. in caſe of Refuſal. One while he pretends an <hi>incomparable excellency</hi> in it, another while, the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameableneſs</hi> of it: Anon he <hi>runs a deſcant upon the Confuſions of our Church ſince it was neglected.</hi> After this, he tels us of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of it, the neceſſity of a <hi>Lyturgy</hi> for the <hi>planting of any Church,</hi> this <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> for the <hi>defending of our Church againſt Popery.</hi> One while he urgeth it, that we might be <hi>conformable to our Prince,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, that <hi>we may be Loyal.</hi> He tels us of the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> as to <hi>Lyturgy, Ceremonies,</hi> what not? He <hi>juſtifies,</hi> not only the Forms of Prayer, but alſo the <hi>Method,</hi> the <hi>Reſponds,</hi> yea, the <hi>Muſick,</hi> the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> the <hi>Catechiſm in the Common Prayer-Book</hi>: One while he tels us, that <hi>men have ſerved God day and night</hi> in the uſe of the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> yea, that <hi>he is perſwaded</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf (had he been alive) would have uſed it; another while, he tels us, how <hi>ſome Miniſters and people have bewailed the neglect of it.</hi>

The Dr. had made our work ſhorter and more methodical if he had told us, which of theſe he accounts <hi>arguments</hi> in the caſe, and which he looked upon as ſtrains of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> onely as to which we needed not have troubled our ſelves with an anſwer; he not doing this, we muſt examine them all, ſuppoſing that the <hi>Dr.</hi> took all theſe for <hi>concluſive Arguments,</hi> in the caſe able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand reaſonable, and religious ſouls to this conformity.</p>
               <p n="3">III. For the pretended <hi>Antiquity of Liturgies,</hi> his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> may gather from what is already ſaid, that we do not believe any ſuch thing, nor hath he ſpoke one word to prove it, we living not in <hi>Pithagoras</hi> his School, have not learned to ſubmit to an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> we deſire him to ſhew us any authority for a <hi>Liturgie</hi> within the firſt <hi>three Centuries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. As to what he ſaith p. 2. That his <hi>moſt Sacred Majeſty</hi> in his <hi>Gracious Declaration hath not dispenſed with the legal, morall, obediential, obligation.</hi> We conceive he means the obligation which lies upon mens conſciences to obſerve the <hi>Civil Laws of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we do not elſe underſtand his meaning.</p>
               <p>If this be it, the <hi>Dr.</hi> hath two things to do; 1. <hi>To prove that the Common-prayer-Book</hi> (vulgarly to be had) <hi>is eſtabliſhed by any Law of England.</hi> (we heard it was openly denied in the houſe of Commons in the laſt Parliament, and we cannot find any Law to that purpoſe, the Laws 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 5 &amp; 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. &amp; 1 <hi>El.</hi> are ſuch, that our conſciences tell us, they daily violate the Law that read theſe books.) In the mean time we ingenuouſly confeſs, That his Majeſties <hi>Declaration,</hi> as it cannot make an <hi>obliging Law,</hi> ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>diſſolve the obligation of it</hi>: but where is the Law? 2. If it could be found, how far doth it <hi>oblige any mans conſcience</hi>? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not to any act of ſin; if we thought we could uſe theſe forms without ſin, we ſhould never diſpute the Law in the caſe, but freely obey the leaſt intimation of his <hi>Sacred Majeſties</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="5">V. For what he tells us p. 8. of the <hi>example of the Church</hi> ſince the firſt <hi>Century,</hi> we can find no <hi>ſuch thing.</hi> VVe have ſaid enough to that c. 3. It is an empty unproved Aſſertion, though we know nothing but <hi>Gods Word</hi> obliging our conſciences, and are to learn that any examples oblige us (but thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles) and therefore for what he tells us p. 3. of ſome Miniſters that have all this <hi>time uſed the Liturgy</hi>: Others that lately have <hi>reaſſumed the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119424:33"/>
uſe of it</hi>: it ſignifies nothing to us who live by the unerring rule of Scripture precepts and <hi>preſidents.</hi> If others will ſin, ſurely it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not us to do ſo too: Though we dare not ſay they did, or do ſin in it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. He urgeth it upon us next from an ingenuous Argument, viz. <hi>Gratitude to his Majeſty for his indulgence.</hi> To which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That we with all humility acknowledge His <hi>Moſt Excellent Majeſties gracious indulgence in it.</hi> And in point of gratitude, are willing to ſerve his <hi>Majeſty</hi> vvith all that is dear unto us (our ſouls only excepted vvhich we know he deſireth not) in token of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> we are ready to part with any <hi>part of our livelyhoods,</hi> and ſhall in that vye with thoſe who pretend moſt to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſervice, (though many of us in ſeveral places have no benefit by his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Declaration, whiles ſome eager <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> and <hi>Juſtices,</hi> ſtill give the <hi>Statutes in charge</hi> againſt us, and cauſe us to be <hi>indicted</hi> and <hi>proſecuted,</hi> openly telling the people that the <hi>Kings Declaration is no Law,</hi> though they alſo know that there is <hi>no Law for the Common-prayer</hi>) yet we have an experiment of his <hi>gracious Majeſties</hi> good will to us his poor Subjects; and ſhall be vvilling by any vvay, which our conſciences tell us would not be ſin to us, to let his <hi>Majeſty</hi> know our <hi>gratitude.</hi> But vve are ſure that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> is more charitable to his peoples ſouls, then to deſire that to expreſs their thankfulneſs to him they ſhould commit the leaſt ſin againſt God. And this is enough to excuſe us from the <hi>Biſhops</hi> raſh charging us with <hi>Moroſity, Reſtiveneſs, Peeviſhneſs, Schiſmatical petulancy,</hi> &amp;c. with none of which men can be charged for any action which they do, or neglect, that they may avoid the guilt of <hi>Sin</hi> before God, whether their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces inform them rightly or no.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. For the many Splendid words, which the Biſhop uſeth p. 23.31. to dazle peoples eyes at the apprehenſion of the <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Liturgy,</hi> they are of no uſe at all, for beſides that if he would have made his words good, he muſt have proved 1. <hi>That the Common-prayer hath in it a perfect Confeſſion of ſuch ſins as all are guilty of.</hi> Original, Actual, of Omiſſion, Commiſſion, <hi>a perfect ſummary of things neceſſary to be begged of God for all:</hi> and a <hi>perfect form of thanksgiving for mercies received,</hi> and all this expreſſed in moſt <hi>Significant Scriptural Language, plain,</hi> and <hi>affective expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and caſt into a <hi>lovely,</hi> and <hi>uſual method,</hi> I ſay beſides this, the <hi>Excellency of no form of words in prayer,</hi> can commend it to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119424:34"/>
be impoſed univerſally, if ſuch impoſing be not lawful. But in ſtead of this the Biſhop gives us a parcel of fine words without a tittle of proof, and contrary to the general apprehenſion of all <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> (who never ſpake it more then tolerable) and to the <hi>judgement of diſcretion</hi>; which the Proteſtant Religion allows to all private perſons: ſo that this is but <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. What he argues for it, <hi>from the invalidity of the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken to it, and the ſuppoſed unblameableneſs of it,</hi> ſignifies as little, for it is blameable enough, as a <hi>form univerſally impoſed.</hi> 2. As formerly <hi>uſed in an idolatrous ſervice</hi>; and for many things which he never ſo much as indeavours to vindicate it from, though told him of old by Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi>

                  </gap>lear it, that thoſe Exceptions will yet ſtand good, ſo will that as to the <hi>tranſlation of the Text</hi> in <hi>Ezech.</hi> for none is ſo ſimple to aſſert, that we can as infallibly give the ſenſe of a Text, and put it in other words with our additions, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; and ſure we are, the Text in <hi>Ezech.</hi> in the letter of it ſpeaks no ſuch thing as our <hi>Liturgy</hi> makes it to ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. For what he urgeth as to the <hi>diſorders, and confuſions in our Church ſince the diſuſe of the Liturgie,</hi> which he much comments upon p. 7, 18, 40. It is no argument to evince the neceſſity or expedience of bringing back the <hi>Liturgie</hi> again, becauſe not the <hi>want of it,</hi> but rather the too long having of it, was the cauſe in a great meaſure. For 1. <hi>In what Congregations were theſe confuſions moſt ordinary?</hi> was it in thoſe Congregations where the <hi>Liturgie</hi> was out of choice laid aſide? which were furniſhed with Godly Learned Miniſters? we appeal to the <hi>Citizens of London</hi> whether they took notice of any ſuch <hi>extravagancies</hi> in their Miniſters? nor can malice it ſelf ſo charge them. But there were two other ſorts of Preachers: 1. There was <hi>an old Sect</hi> who had ſo uſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> that they had loſt <hi>all their gifts,</hi> and being reſtrained in the uſe of thoſe forms, and not having a <hi>ſpirit</hi> or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119424:34"/>
                  <hi>heart</hi> ſuted to their work <hi>could do juſt nothing.</hi> 2. There was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Set of <hi>Lay-preachers,</hi> and <hi>raw young Students</hi> got into livings, many of whom were alſo corrupted in their <hi>judgements,</hi> and it is no great wonder ſome of them ſhould be juſtly chargeable. The queſtion is, what ſuch confuſions there would have been, had none been admitted into livings but ſuch as were duly qualified.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Above all things we wonder, why a form of words in prayer <hi>at the adminiſtration of the Sacraments,</hi> ſhould be judged ſo highly neceſſary to be preſcribed; for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper as it is an Ordinance which requires the greateſt <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> both as to him that adminiſters, and thoſe <hi>that receive</hi>: ſo we cannot but think it very <hi>hard</hi> that any <hi>diverſion</hi> ſhould be offered to the Miniſters ſoul in <hi>prayer</hi> there, and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> that he ſhould do any thing which might either abate the <hi>fervor of his own ſpirit,</hi> or be leſs <hi>affective of his peoples hearts.</hi> For the forms of words <hi>in Conſecration</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> we think it no way fit the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould vary a tittle <hi>from the inſtitution,</hi> where Chriſt hath left us words ſufficient. Nor can we allow the <hi>Liturgie</hi>'s turning the words to be ſpoken at the <hi>delivery of the Sacrament</hi> into a <hi>prayer,</hi> being no wayes agreeable to the Inſtitution. The ſame is to be ſaid as to the other Sacrament, onely if an explicit enumeration of the chief heads of the Doctrine of Faith, (to which the Parents aſſent is required) be judged neceſſary, we think it warrantable, and ſhould freely allow the Church to <hi>preſcribe a form</hi> there, and to enjoyn the <hi>obſervation</hi> of the Scriptural form of words in both adminiſtrations to be uſed, and no other.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. As to the deſires of the moſt <hi>Learned and Judicious, and Godly</hi> of the people, which the <hi>Dr.</hi> mentions p. 7. we ſee no ſuch thing, but the quite contrary, and dare almoſt venture it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>vote of ſuch</hi> in our Pariſhes, as are not guilty of noted <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery,</hi> and have any <hi>form of Religion</hi> in their families, and can give us a rational anſwer why they deſire it.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. We do freely allow that no Miniſter ought to oppoſe his private <hi>Spirit to the Spirit of the Prophets united</hi>: but yet muſt maintain for every Miniſter <hi>a judgement of diſcretion,</hi> (which vvhen vve have once diſputed out of the world, <hi>Popery</hi> will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceed, &amp; nothing remains but <hi>blind obedience</hi>) wet do allow a due honour to ſome of thoſe <hi>Reverend perſons</hi> that had an hand in compoſing the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and do think they did worthily in their <hi>generation,</hi> according to that twilight of Goſpel light, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119424:35"/>
after a midnight of <hi>Popiſh darkneſs</hi> ſhone out upon them: we do allow them to have done <hi>prudently,</hi> reſpecting the State of the Engliſh Nation at that time, (<hi>Rome</hi> could not be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down in a day) but we alſo know, how imperfect their <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> were, and how <hi>gradually</hi> they reformed their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is ſufficiently known that one of the moſt Eminent of them, (holy <hi>Cranmer</hi>) was one of them, who (at that time him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being a profeſſed Proteſtant) condemned that rare <hi>Martyr Lambert,</hi> for denying the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> In the witneſs of which truth in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes himſelf (upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light) ſuffered Martyrdom. We believe he did both in the ſincerity of his heart, and onely mention this to ſhew, that thoſe <hi>Eminent lights</hi> were not fitted to ſet a ſtanding and perpetual rule to the Church in ſo great an affair as this is.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. But if as the Biſhop ſaith p. 3. Neither <hi>piety</hi> nor <hi>policy, will allow the diſcompoſing or diſſolving</hi> the whole frame of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</hi> And if as he tells us p. 12. <hi>The Reformed part of Religion cannot be well preſerved in England to any flouriſhing and uniform State, unleſs ſuch Liturgy be authoritatively injoined, and conſtantly maintained.</hi> Then unqueſtionably it ought to be as he dictateth. And if as he tells us p. 23. <hi>The Liturgy of England as to the main eſſentials of it in Doctrine, Devotion, Conſecration, and Celebration, for matter, order and method, be ſuch as may not be maimed.</hi> If (as p. 31.) <hi>nothing can ever be ſeen comparable to this Liturgie, if it be nulled and deſtroyed,</hi> and if <hi>after it be reviewed, it be not by Law, reeſtabliſhed</hi> and <hi>authoritatively enjoined, Truth and peace can never be eſtabliſhed</hi>; there's all the reaſon in the world that we ſhould have it, better that thoſe thouſands of Godly Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who cannot ſubmit to it, ſhould be baniſhed the Land, then ſuch evils come by hearkening to them, or ſuch good things be hindred by their <hi>non-conformity.</hi> But let us ſearch the bottom of this heap of words, &amp; ſee what ſtrength of <hi>Reaſon</hi> there is in them.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. He gives three reaſons for his former aſſertion, <hi>That it is againſt piety and policy to alter it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It would reproach the wiſdom, and blemiſh the piety of the first compoſers of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It would imprudently diſparage the judgement and devotion of the whole Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It would much damp and diſcourage the preſent zeal and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greateſt and chiefeſt part of this Nation, who are much pleaſed and profited by the uſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:119424:35"/>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The alteration is againſt Piety and Policy.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. For the firſt, We would be loath either to reproach the <hi>Piety,</hi> or blemiſh the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>firſt Reformers</hi>; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand how the one or the other ſhould be reproached, by not <hi>impoſing</hi> a <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> or not <hi>impoſing this Lyturgy.</hi> Was the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> reproached by the diſuſe of the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> which yet was an excellent <hi>Schoolmaſter to bring the Jews to Chriſt?</hi> Or is the wiſdom or prudence of <hi>William Lilly</hi> or any other Maſter of Grammar reproached, becauſe when the Boy comes to be Maſter of Arts, he no longer makes <hi>Latine by Grammar Rules,</hi> nor further uſeth it than at a pinch now and then? Certainly thoſe firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers did like <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>pious men,</hi> with reſpect to their age, the <hi>complexion</hi> of the People, the <hi>abilities</hi> of the then-Miniſters. But if that we have not improved both in <hi>Reformation</hi> and in all <hi>Gifts,</hi> very much ſince that time (now 100 years) we have wofully abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our mercies. And it is the honour of our <hi>firſt Reformers,</hi> that by <hi>their means who firſt tranſlated the Service-Book</hi> into Engliſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there are ſo many thouſand Miniſters to be found now in <hi>England,</hi> who are able to ſpeak unto God before people, as well and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if they did read thoſe Forms. Is it not ſo to the <hi>Schoolmaſter,</hi> who by dictating Forms of <hi>Theams</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi> and <hi>Orations,</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Boyes to make as good, and better than his were, in 9 or 10 years time? Surely it were rather a reproach to the <hi>Schoolmaster,</hi> ſo to inure his Boyes to Forms, that when they are Maſters of Art, they muſt ſtill have Forms dictated to them, without which they can do nothing.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Nor would the <hi>alteration of this Lyturgy,</hi> and not <hi>impoſing any,</hi> blemiſh <hi>the Judgment of our whole Church,</hi> our <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. Their Judgment was excellent as to thoſe times. In King <hi>Edward</hi> his time, the Clergy were generally <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and had they been left to Liberty, would certainly have uſed the <hi>Maſs,</hi> or elſe ſuch perſons as were of mean parts, moſt of them <hi>Anglice docti,</hi> ſuch as the neceſſity of thoſe times required, becauſe better could not be had. In Qu. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, the ſtate of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (at leaſt in the beginning of her Reign) was little better; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Record which Archbiſhop <hi>Parker</hi> left, (and is yet to be ſeen in the Library of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge)</hi> of all the Miniſters in his <hi>Province,</hi> and their ſeveral abilities, where are 20 <hi>Anglice docti,</hi> ſuch as underſtood no Latine, for one that hath a Character for any Learning ſee upon him; this man was

Archbiſhop in the Second year of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Undoubtedly it was an Act of rare Judgment for the Parliament then to <hi>impoſe Forms of Prayer,</hi> nor was it likely that ſuddenly the whole Nation would be reformed ſo well, that with any ſecurity or prudence, the Miniſters could be left at liberty. Since the time of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> no <hi>Parliament</hi> medled with it: King <hi>James</hi> indeed reformed it in part, and declared his Judgment for it. King <hi>Charles</hi> (of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Memory) in his <hi>Meditation</hi> upon the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he judgeth an impoſed <hi>Lyturgy</hi> lawful, and this as to the main very good) yet declareth his readineſs to have conſented to <hi>amend what upon free and publick advice, might ſeem to ſober men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient as to matter or manner</hi>; by which it appears, that his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> judged incapable of amendment both as to <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">XVII. But it is a great Riddle to us, how the <hi>amending of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> and not <hi>impoſing any univerſally, ſhould damp and diſcourage the zeal of the greateſt and chiefeſt part of the Nation, who find much pleaſure and profit in the uſe of it.</hi> For if it be ſtill left at liberty to them, if they pleaſe to uſe the old Forms, how is their Zeal <hi>damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>diſcouraged,</hi> by the liberty which others take? It is a fiery Zeal in men certainly, that muſt needs have all others to be of their humour, as to the uſe of <hi>Forms of words</hi> in Prayer. If by <hi>zeal,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi> means the <hi>Fury of people</hi> againſt thoſe who durſt not uſe thoſe Forms, the God of Heaven more damp and diſcourage that zeal, which we are ſure is not <hi>according to knowledge.</hi> If the greateſt and chiefeſt part of the Nation be ſo zealous in this caſe, doubtleſs if they be left to liberty, people will generally fill in with thoſe Miniſters that do uſe it, and there will be an <hi>ingenuous conformity,</hi> which is alwaies beſt; for a little experience will convince the <hi>furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones</hi> of this age, that Religion is a thing that muſt <hi>instillari,</hi> not <hi>intrudi</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> ſomtimes ſaid) a thing to be gently inſtilled and commended, not bluntly and forcibly intruded and compelled. Our <hi>Biſhops</hi> in this point may give counſel effectual to the <hi>filling of Goals,</hi> undoing of many thouſands, and procuring their cries unto God againſt them, but never effectual to accompliſh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, if indeed their deſigns be to bring all to an uniformity in this thing. But they very well know, that if it be left to liberty to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to uſe or not uſe the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> that experience will quickly make it appear, <hi>that the greater part of more knowing and zealous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> are not ſo enamoured upon it, as they proclaim them to the world to be.</p>

In the next place, he tels us, <hi>The Reformed part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cannot be well preſerved in</hi> England <hi>without it, to any flouriſhing and uniform eſtate.</hi> Immediatly before, he told us, <hi>Religion could not any where be planted without a Lyturgy:</hi> Both of them, Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of equal truth. If Religion could not be planted without a <hi>Common Prayer-Book,</hi> it is a wonder that the Apoſtles and Paſtors of the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> miſſed this only means: For what <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> was ever heard of in the Church for 400 years after Chriſt? (the great planting time) if the <hi>Reformation of Religion</hi> cannot be <hi>preſerved</hi> without a <hi>Lyturgy impoſed,</hi> or <hi>this Lyturgy,</hi> alas for the Churches of God in <hi>Scotland, Holland, France, Genevah!</hi> If they have a Lyturgy, how unlike is it to this? Nor is it impoſed, nor the uſe of it, by penalties compelled; yet bleſſed be God, the Reformation in thoſe Churches is not leſs perfect than ours, not leſs firmly preſerved: Let their Confeſſions of Faith be read, or their printed Books againſt the Papiſts be read, and compared with ours, and let all judge: What ſingular thing then is there in the Conſtitution of men and women in <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> in its <hi>Reformed part</hi> cannot ſubſiſt without the authoritative impoſing of a <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> taken out of the <hi>Roman Miſſal</hi> (as to the far greater part?) Surely none will ſay, it is becauſe the <hi>Reformed Party</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have a more reverend opinion of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than the Reformed Party in other Nations hath: This indeed were a ſhameful reproach to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let her Enemies lay it to her charge; but let her true Sons ſpend their time in covering ſuch nakedneſs. VVe muſt know the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's</hi> Reaſons, before we can believe any truth in this, eſpecially when we know that thoſe Miniſters and people, who are moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> are moſt averſe to this <hi>Lyturgy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">XIX.

We muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that ſome Forms of Prayer preſcribed to be read at the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, are very good and pious; but we are much of his mind, who ſaid, <hi>Nihil ego puto a quovis praeſcriptum tam exacte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quin addi aliquid poſſit, aut perfectius reddi, a quovis qui miniſterio dignus,</hi>

aut exhortantis liberè in verba. Nam ut aſſiciat auditores, oportet ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum aſſici, non autem afficitur ut debet, qui ſemper eiſdem verbis orat, aut exhortatur.</hi> It is an uſual ſaying, and may be true enough, <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus Orator non nondum naſcitur.</hi> To ſay that either for matter or phraſe there was never any Prayers made like to thoſe, and that no ſuch can be made, are ſtrange, extravagant, and hyperbolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, by no means either to be <hi>juſtified</hi> or <hi>demonſtrated.</hi> In ſhort, thoſe Forms of words in Prayer are undoubtedly beſt for the <hi>Speakers uſe,</hi> which come moſt from the <hi>intention of his mind</hi> and <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of his Spirit.</hi> As to others joyning with him, thoſe are beſt, which moſt affect the Hearers hearts. That theſe, or any Forms upon this account do ſo, is not demonſtrable. For the <hi>Form of Conſecration of the Lords Supper</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh Lyturgy,</hi> we cannot find any <hi>Form for it</hi> (which we think an <hi>high Omiſſion</hi>) we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Conſecration ſhould be by <hi>reading the words of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, taking,</hi> and <hi>breaking the Bread,</hi> and then <hi>bleſſing it</hi>: We find only a Form of Prayer for a Bleſſing upon the Elements, and not ſo much as a <hi>Rubrick</hi> directing the Miniſter at that time to read the words of <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> or to <hi>take</hi> and <hi>break</hi> the Bread. As for the words uſed in the <hi>delivery of the Sacrament,</hi> we find them (without any warrant from Gods Word) turned into Prayers: So that the Biſhop might have ſpared the commending of this Part of the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> where we think is a more conſiderable <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of what ſhould be there, than he can inſtance in, in our <hi>adminiſtrations,</hi> or then the omiſſion of thoſe words, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt</hi> in <hi>Ordination</hi> is, eſpecially when we know no ſuch power any Miniſters have now to give the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had, and can eaſily diſtinguiſh betwixt the Apoſtles ordinary Act in <hi>Ordination,</hi> and their extraordinary Act in <hi>giving the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; to the latter of which, none can now pretend. For the <hi>Ancientry</hi> of theſe Forms, we have ſhewed it before, they are not of age enough to ſpeak for themſelves, and to plead their <hi>gray hairs</hi> for their continuance.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. To ſay, <hi>That without the authoritative impoſing of this, or any other Lyturgy, Truth and Peace can never be eſtabliſhed,</hi> is irrational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gueſſed, nor can there he any pretence for it: Certainly <hi>truth</hi> is far better preſerved by a <hi>full and ſound Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> in a <hi>Form of ſound words,</hi> in which all are agreed, and we ſhould be content to read a ſhort ſummary of it every Lords day, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, own, defend it; that it ſhould be ſubſcribed and ſworn by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119424:37"/>
all <hi>Commencers in Univerſities,</hi> by all <hi>to be ordained,</hi> or <hi>admitted into livings,</hi> by all <hi>admitted to Sacraments</hi>; how an <hi>impoſed Liturgie</hi> ſhould do half ſo much, nay how it ſhould do any thing at all to preſerve <hi>Truth,</hi> we cannot gueſs.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. For <hi>Peace,</hi> we have had the experience of an 100. years to prove the contrary; ſure we are that we may thank the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Liturgie</hi> in former times, for all our <hi>Brownists, Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists, Quakers, Familists, Sectaries</hi> of all ſorts. Their Leaders firſt ſeparated from the Church for the <hi>Common-prayer Book</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> then ſet up for themſelves, and being themſelves <hi>unskilful in the Word of Righteouſneſs,</hi> eaſily perverted others. And we are ſure that there are now 100. for every one that diſtaſted theſe things in 1640. both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>people</hi>; how the reimpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhould bring us to <hi>Peace</hi> poſeth us to prophecy. It may bring many thouſands of perſons to ruine, for not conforming, driving them into other lands, giving their malitious adverſaries advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to fill priſons with them; but <hi>Peace</hi> it can never bring.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. We obſerve that all <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> where are no ſuch impoſings of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> have more plenty of able Divines, (conſidering the proportion of their ground,) more <hi>zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> fewer <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> then ever <hi>England</hi> had at any time when the <hi>Liturgie</hi> was moſt rigorouſly impoſed. Nor is it reaſonable to imagine that we ſhould ever have any peace in the Church, if the former <hi>Liturgie</hi> be impoſed, but continual <hi>ſeparations</hi> from the Church, and violent proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe whole conſciences for the reaſons aforeſaid, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow them to uſe it.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. So that we humbly crave leave to retort this as an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> againſt the <hi>Impoſing,</hi> either this, or any other <hi>Liturgie,</hi> Its being inconſiſtent with the peace of this Church. And we moſt humbly beſeech <hi>His moſt Excellent Majeſty, the Noble Lords,</hi> and the <hi>Gentlemen of England,</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider, <hi>Whether</hi> there being <hi>no command in Scripture,</hi> nor <hi>particular warrant</hi> for any <hi>impoſings</hi> of this nature, <hi>no preſident of the primitive Church</hi> in any part for 400 years after Chriſt; there being alſo ſuch a <hi>plenty of Godly able Miniſters</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; So many times <hi>ten thouſand of Godly Chriſtians,</hi> who cannot allow themſelves in the worſhip of God by forms of prayer; and who have taken ſo great a ſcandal at theſe forms in particular, and that for reaſons above mentioned: It can conſiſt either with <hi>Piety</hi> in them to enjoyn
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119424:38"/>
what is ſo <hi>highly offenſive,</hi> (when St. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth ſo much tenderneſs to his <hi>weak brethren</hi>) or <hi>with Policy,</hi> to enjoyn that in which they cannot but know that many thouſands will be found who durſt not actively <hi>Obey,</hi> but will think themſelves bound to ſuffer? So that they will be conſtrained in purſuance of their <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> (commanding ſuch things) to <hi>erect Courts, direct proſecutions</hi> of perſons, only blameable in this matter of their God, and ſuch who are ready by any <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Oath</hi> to ſecure their <hi>Allegiance to his Majeſty,</hi> by any <hi>Action</hi> to expreſs it, <hi>paying tributes,</hi> and cuſtomes for <hi>conſcience ſake</hi>; daily <hi>praying for all the bleſſings of heaven and earth</hi> for his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and this with far more cordiality then others <hi>drink His healths.</hi> Or whether ſuch proceedings be like to produce <hi>Peace</hi> in the Church, or rather everlaſting <hi>diviſions, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities,</hi> and <hi>conſtant proſecutions</hi> of ſober <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> concerning the equity of which the <hi>Juſt Judge of the whole earth</hi> muſt one day enquire? And in the mean time theſe <hi>Impoſitions</hi> to be of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderable uſe, then to help <hi>ignorant perſons</hi> unfit for the Miniſtry, and ſuch as are <hi>lazy and negligent,</hi> and make no conſcience to <hi>ſtir up the gift of God</hi> in them. We humbly leave this to our Superiours to determine.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. The queſtions as to piety are, 1. <hi>Whether pious Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, can according to principles of piety, command and enforce thoſe things, which Gods Word doth not command in his worſhip, being openly offenſive to multitudes of Godly people?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether they can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit their ſoules to God in making Laws, to fine, diſturb, impriſon, baniſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>multitudes of their Subjects for no other crime then this, that they cannot limit themſelves to forms of prayer in Gods Worſhip?</hi> And ſuppoſe theſe two things were conſiſtent with <hi>Piety,</hi> yet whether <hi>Policy</hi> would direct it? is another queſtion; why ſhould ſo many good Subjects be loſt to a Nation? why ſhould they have temptations to eſtrange their hearts from the ancient and excellent government thereof? But matters of policy, we moſt humbly leave to the grave wiſdom and deliberations of His Sacred <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> and His <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Onely we muſt add a word to one or two Suggeſtions more, which the <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath for the impoſing of the <hi>Liturgy.</hi>

               <p n="3">III.

               <p n="4">IV. But it is more then we know that any ſuch <hi>Church</hi> as this, ever eſtabliſhed a <hi>Liturgie</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> The Papiſts have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed a new notion of a <hi>Church,</hi> to them the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> make the Church; but that any ſuch notion of Church is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable from Scriptures, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deny.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Our State hath been pleaſed in ſome <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> to take <hi>Church</hi> in another notion, and to call the <hi>Prelacy of England,</hi> the <hi>Church of England.</hi> That this application of the term <hi>Church</hi> is not to be juſtified from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is plain; nor is it needful: they may if they pleaſe, call the <hi>Prelacy of England</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi>; or by what other name they pleaſe, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? But they cannot give them that <hi>Authority,</hi> which the word of God allows onely to a <hi>Church</hi> in another notion; but may cloath them with vvhat civil power they pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Hence it appears, that it is all one vvith us in <hi>England</hi> to baffle or deſpiſe the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>; for that company of men whom vve call the <hi>Church of England</hi> (by a new civil application of the term) is nothing elſe, <hi>Then a company of men by a Civil Power made Biſhops, and called to adviſe the State, in things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion; who have no more Authority then they derive from the King or Parliament,</hi> for whence ſhould they have it? Not <hi>from Nature</hi>; Surely no <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> power is derived from thence; Not <hi>from Scripture</hi> upon any pretence, for if vvhen Chriſt gave the Keyes to <hi>Peter,</hi> he intended <hi>his ſingle perſon</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> vvould have it; then St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſucceſſor only can pretend to them, if he gave them to <hi>Peter,</hi> as an <hi>Officer</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; then there muſt be either a full <hi>Convention of ſuch Officers,</hi> or ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>choſen by them</hi> to uſe them: If to <hi>Peter</hi> as a Chriſtian, then the <hi>Authority</hi> is in the Community.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It remains, that according to the Conſtitution of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>Synods,</hi> the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> is but derivative from the <hi>Civil State</hi>; and to diſobey them, is no ſin, further then <hi>it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the lawful Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> to vvhom vve freely grant an authority, ſo far as Gods vvord allows us, and ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as none ought to reſiſt or baffle, (as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſayes.) The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119424:39"/>
                  <hi>Church of England,</hi> which we ſo often hear of, is a <hi>Civil Church,</hi> not an authoritative <hi>Church</hi> in a Scriptural notion.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII.

               <p n="8">VIII. We can find but five pieces of ſeeming <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Diſcourſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Angels began the Quire at Chriſts Nativity</hi>: He is not in good earneſt ſure to ſuggeſt to the world, that the Angels brought any <hi>Muſical Inſtruments</hi> down with them from Heaven: If not, his Argument muſt be; That it is as lawful for us to praiſe God in publick Acts of worſhip, with <hi>Inſtruments of Muſick,</hi> as for the <hi>Angels to rejoyce.</hi> But now ſhall that appear? We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no more that the <hi>Angels</hi> taught men (by that jubilation) the uſe of <hi>Church-Muſick,</hi> than the idle ſtory <hi>Socrates</hi> tels us, of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> his learning the Method of <hi>Responds,</hi> by a <hi>Viſion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> anſwering one another, like ſo many Quiriſters; which as <hi>Hospinian,</hi> and others ſay, was not ſurely ſuch a momentous piece of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as that God ſhould ſend <hi>Angels</hi> down to exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. But the <hi>Biſhop</hi> tels us, we have as much <hi>cauſe to rejoyce,</hi> as the <hi>Jews had</hi>: True. And God forbid but we ſhould <hi>rejoyce</hi> with <hi>equal joy</hi>: But muſt it be in the ſame <hi>carnal manner too</hi>? Have we had any Command of God (as they had) for any ſuch Service? Why ſhould we not have <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and <hi>blow</hi> with them, as they did too? Yea, and have <hi>Altars, and Cenſers,</hi> and <hi>Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>Thank-Offerings</hi> as they had? Who is ſo blind, as not to ſee through theſe Paper-Arguments?</p>
               <p n="10">X. Thirdly, The <hi>Biſhop</hi> tels us, Muſick <hi>is a Gift of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Gift of conceived Prayer is a gift of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and it is fit, <hi>God (in his Service</hi>) and Church ſhould have the uſe of ſo <hi>Orient a Pearl.</hi> That <hi>Muſick</hi> is the <hi>gift</hi> of God, none can deny, nor yet, that God ought to be ſerved with all his Gifts; But is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119424:42"/>
there no way to ſerve God with the uſe of this his Gift, but to uſe it in his worſhip? Are there not 100 other things that are the Gifts of God, of which yet there is no uſe in the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi>? The <hi>Biſhop</hi> will ſay (it may be) if we may <hi>ſerve God</hi> with it, why not uſe it in his <hi>Worſhip?</hi> We anſwer, becauſe <hi>God hath not commanded it.</hi> And it is to ſet up our <hi>poſts</hi> by <hi>Gods poſts,</hi> and our <hi>Threſholds</hi> by <hi>his thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds.</hi> This is enough, but much more might be ſaid, and ſhall be ſaid by and by.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>Ah</hi>! But he tels us, Fourthly, <hi>It is an exerciſe that fits the duty of Praiſe and fitteth mens Spirits in it:</hi> We think, it fitteth ſome, far better than others, and the <hi>carnal part</hi> of any, better than their <hi>ſpiritual part.</hi> But we think <hi>we ſhall never have done, if we ſtand diſputing (after our Saviours perfect Rule given in the Goſpel) what is ſitting for his Houſe.</hi> Our Saviour knew, that <hi>Muſick</hi> was a <hi>Gift of God,</hi> and fit to <hi>exhilerate perſons.</hi> And ſurely when one is dead, his or her relations had need of ſomthing to chear their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Yet we find, our Saviour gives no great countenance to the <hi>Muſitians,</hi> nor doth any Miracle till they be gone; nor do we find him in the leaſt apointing or countenancing <hi>Muſick</hi> in any act of <hi>Worſhip</hi>: How well it fitteth mens Spirits, we ſhall hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by and by, from the obſervation of others.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But he tels us, that the uſe of <hi>Muſick</hi> in <hi>Gods worſhip,</hi> is as lawful as ſinging by <hi>Meeter</hi> &amp; <hi>Tunes,</hi> as any <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> or <hi>Hymno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy:</hi> We ſhall believe this at leiſure, becauſe we read of Chriſts ſinging an <hi>Hymn,</hi> and of the Apoſtles directions and <hi>Command, Eph.</hi> 5.19. by which we are obliged to ſing <hi>Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, making Melody in our hearts to the Lord.</hi> But never of any <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Direction</hi> for <hi>Muſical Inſtruments.</hi> We are miſtaken if thoſe words, <hi>Pſalms, Hymns, Songs</hi> do not imply words caſt into a metrical order. <hi>Tunes</hi> are neceſſary, as <hi>circumſtances,</hi> without which, nature it ſelf would teach us, that the performance is <hi>undecent</hi> and <hi>diſorderly,</hi> and apparently ſo to all that ſhould hear.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. But it will not be amiſs to take a view of the <hi>Judgment of Divines in all times,</hi> concerning the uſe of <hi>Muſick</hi> in Churches; by which it will appear, what devout, holy and good men have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, or have by experience found true concerning the uſe of it.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. We ſhewed before, that <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and the Church in his time, judged it a <hi>puerile Service,</hi> and upon that account, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it not in the <hi>Church</hi>; nor can any reaſonably expect, that any of the <hi>Ancients</hi> ſhould explicitly declare themſelves, againſt the uſe of <hi>Muſick</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> when it is apparent, that for 900
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119424:42"/>
years after Chriſt there was no ſuch practice, yet much may be found in them; from which we may judge what (had it then been come into Churches) would have been their ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. <hi>Lactantius</hi> falls very foully upon the heathen, for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>That their Gods did love what they affected,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inſtitut. l. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> and for coming <hi>to the worſhip of God</hi> to <hi>look upon the Gold of the Temple,</hi> the <hi>fine Marble</hi> and <hi>Ivory,</hi> the <hi>brave Stones,</hi> and <hi>fine Habits,</hi> and for <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that their Temples had ſo much the more Majeſty,</hi> by how much they were more <hi>gay,</hi> and <hi>adorned.</hi> So that (ſaith he) <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nothing elſe</hi> but <hi>Cupiditas humana,</hi> [mens luſt.] men think that muſt needs pleaſe God, which pleaſeth them.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. It is true, <hi>Singing</hi> was early in the <hi>Eaſtern Church,</hi> as we learn by the account of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> behaviour, which <hi>Pliny</hi> gives to <hi>Trajan.</hi> But the <hi>Weſtern Church</hi> received <hi>ſinging</hi> very late, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is ſaid firſt to have uſed it at <hi>Millan,</hi> when with his Congregation he kept the Church againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that the night-watchings might be leſs tedious.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Let us hear St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking, from whence it will not be hard to judge vvhat that <hi>Reverend</hi> perſon's opinion was about the <hi>ſinging</hi> then uſed, and its fittedneſs to the duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in praiſing God; it is in his 10th. book of <hi>Confeſſions</hi> cap. 33, vve will tranſlate it for the <hi>Reader.</hi>

                  <q>The pleaſures of the ear had entangled, and captivated me, but thou (O Lord) haſt looſed and delivered me: now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I do acquieſce in thoſe ſounds, which thy Oracles enliven, vvhen they are ſang with a ſweet artificial voice.

But vvhen they come unto me in the very phraſes, wherein they live, they ſeek in my heart a place of dignity, and I can ſcarce afford them one fitting for them.

But vvhen I again remember the rears I powred out (at my converſion) at the <hi>Singing of the Church,</hi> and how I am ſtill affected, not with the ſinging, but vvith the things that are ſang, vvith a clear diſtinct voice, and a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tuning: I again acknowledge the great profit of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>i.e. Singing.</hi> I am thus divided betwixt the danger of pleaſure, and my experiment of <hi>wholeſomeneſs,</hi> and rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline (yet not pronouncing an irrevocable ſentence) to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the practice of ſinging in the Church, that <hi>weaker Souls</hi> may by the delight of the ears, be raiſed up in pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                  <q>In this buſineſs 'tis admirable how the cuſtom of the Church is altered; St. <hi>Paul</hi> had rather ſpeak five words to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, then ten thouſand [<hi>in ſpiratu</hi>] not to be underſtood. But now in ſome Countries they ſing all day in ſpirit (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſo as none underſtands them) there's neither meaſure nor end of ſinging, vvhen as ſcarcely in 6. moneths a good Sermon is heard, perſwading to true piety (that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls ſpeaking in underſtanding) to ſay nothing, that in the mean time a kind of Muſick is brought in too, to the worſhip of God, that none can clearly underſtand any voice. Nor have they that ſing any leiſure to attend to what they ſing. Onely a noiſe of voices ſtrikes their ears, and pleaſeth them with a momentany delight. And this might be born, but that the rout of Prieſts and Monks place all piety in this, vvonderfully differing from St. <hi>Paul</hi>; why
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119424:44"/>
doth the Church doubt to follow ſo great an Author? yea, how dare it diſſent from him? what elſe is heard in Colledges, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, Churches, but a roaring of voices? But in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time there was no ſinging but pronuntiation meerly. Singing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vvas entertained, but ſuch as was nothing elſe but a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and diſtinct pronouncing of the words. Such as vve uſe in rehearſing the Lords prayer, and the common people too, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Language uſed: now what doth the common people underſtand but noiſes ſignifying nothing? onely a ſound ſtrikes their ears? And theſe things being firſt received under a ſpecies or ſhew of piety, by degrees came to that, that there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, nor meaſure of <hi>Pſalms, Songs, Anthemes, Dirges,</hi> &amp;c. that we might ſee they made proficiency. And which is yet more grievous, Prieſts are more ſtrictly tied to theſe things then to the commands of Chriſt. To hear this the people muſt be conſtrained to leave their labour, with vvhich they muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their wives and children (what can be more ſacred?) Let Churches have their ſolemn ſingings, but moderate. But we that are imployed in private affairs, muſt be alſo compelled to theſe things, and carry about a quire with us in <hi>Ships, Coaches,</hi> &amp;c. And from the obſervation of theſe, or the neglect of them, we are judged godly, or ungodly. Let a man be a greater world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then <hi>Craſſus,</hi> a greater reviler then <hi>Zoilus,</hi> yet is he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a devout man, becauſe he ſings ſervice well, although he underſtands nothing of it. I beſeech you vvhat do theſe men think of Chriſt, who think he is pleaſed with ſuch roarings of voice? Nor are they content with this, but we have alſo brought into Churches, a laborious, and theatrical muſick, a tumultuous pratling of divers voices, ſuch a one as I think was never heard upon any ſtage amongſt the <hi>Graecians</hi> or <hi>Romanes.</hi> All places roar with Trumpets, Pipes, Cornets, Dulcimers, and with theſe mens voices are mixed; <hi>Love ſongs,</hi> and other filthy ſongs, (to which vvhores and mimicks dance) are heard. People run to Church as to a ſtage to tickle their ears; and for this uſe are bred <hi>Organiſts,</hi> and <hi>Choriſters,</hi> and maintained at great charge: children's age is ſpent in learning ſuch pratling, while in the mean time they learn nothing that good is. A rabble of ſorbid and light perſons is bred, and the Church is loaded with the maintenance of them, and that too for a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent imployment. I beſeech you, do but count how many poor
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119424:44"/>
people ready to famiſh, might be maintained with the ſalaries of theſe Singing-men? Theſe things do ſo pleaſe them, that among the <hi>Brittains</hi> (eſpecially) the Monks do nothing elſe. Thoſe vvhoſe ſinging ſhould be mourning, think God is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed with their laſcivious neighings and moveable throats. For this purpoſe alſo, boyes, and ſtriplings, and Artiſts in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are bred up amongſt the <hi>Brittains,</hi> for the nonce (forſooth) to ſing a <hi>fine-tuned Song,</hi> and ſo play a leſſon on the <hi>Organs</hi> to the holy <hi>Virgin</hi>-Mother. And the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are conſtrained at their houſes to breed up and maintain ſuch Choriſters, And [<hi>the Monks</hi>] wholly taken up with theſe things, never underſtand any learning, nor any thing in which true Religion conſiſteth. Now thoſe that have thick-pates, and cannot learn Muſick, think they do not do their duty on an holy-day, if they do not uſe a ſcurvy kind of ſinging, which they call <hi>Jauburdum,</hi> that neither recites any thing preſcribed, nor keeps any harmony of Art. Add to this, that whereas ſober Muſick was brought into the Church, that the thing Sang might more affect the hearers mind, they think it a brave thing, if one or other of them, can roar, or bellow ſo loud, that none can hear a word. In this they indulge fools affections, and provide for their own bellies, Why ſhould theſe things onely pleaſe us? which <hi>Paul</hi> would have ſparingly uſed (according to the fancy of little ones) yea, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have indured? he ſpeaks of Sacred reading, not of Stage-play-ſinging. Let us ſing in the ſpirit, but let us ſing Chriſtian-like, let us ſing ſparingly, rather let us ſing with the heart, let us ſpeak with tongues, but ſeldom, let us prophecy more ſtudiouſly. Let rather be heard the voice of the Preacher, reproving the conſcience, comforting the dejected, quickning drouſie ſouls, opening the Sacred Spirits myſteries, and let tender age be rather ſpent in theſe things.</q>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>They fall not under the Second, but the Third, Fourth and Fifth Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>They are like Cloaths, fitted to our Bodies, and Perwicks to our Head, and Tunes to our Pſlams.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. <hi>They do not burden any Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>It is moſt true, and undeniably to be maintained, even unto the death. That this National Church, as well others, hath from the Word of God Liberty, Power and Authority, within its own Polity and Bounds to judge of what ſeemeth to it moſt orderly and decent, as to any Ceremony or Circumſtance in the Worſhip of God, which the Lord hath
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119424:46"/>
left unconfined, free, and indifferent in its own nature, and only to be confined, or regulated, by every ſuch Eccleſiaſtical polity within it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We muſt in our examination of this <hi>Harangue</hi> of diſcourſe, crave leave to alter his <hi>Lordſhips</hi> method, and to begin with the laſt thing firſt; for if the Lord hath left to the Church or State, no ſuch power at large, or if it be bounded by ſome general rules to be obſerved in the exerciſe, which are not obſerved in ſome particular impoſitions, all the former pleas, that they <hi>are few, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal marks,</hi> &amp;c. not <hi>Sacramental ſign,</hi> &amp;c. come to juſt nothing. Yet we cannot but obſerve, how the <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath provided a way to light upon his legs (ſay what we will.) For it cannot be denied but the Church hath a full power <hi>from the Word of God, within its own polity and bounds, to judge of what ſeemeth to it moſt orderly and decent, as to any circumſtance in the worſhip of God, which the Lord hath left unconfined, free and indifferent in its own nature. And only to be confined or regulated by every ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Polity within it ſelf. i.e.</hi> The Lord hath left that to be regulated by the Church, which he hath left to be regulated by the Church. A moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous, and undoubted truth! never denied by any. But that is not the queſtion: This is the queſtion; <hi>Whether it be the will of God, that the Church ſhould regulate and determine, all things which the Word of God hath left indifferent as to his worſhip</hi>; or, whether God by leaving them indifferent, hath not declared his will that the Church ſhould ſo leave them too?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Yet were the firſt part determined affirmatively, it would not reach the mark, for it would then be queried, <hi>Whether the particular Ceremonies appointed for us, be ſuch, conſidering the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scripture, or the circumſtances of thoſe Ceremonies, with the reaſon, and conſequents of Scripture Text, that they (under thoſe circumſtances conſidered) can be lookt upon as indifferent yea or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> is yet confounding us with the complicated notion of the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> there are no <hi>Ceremonies</hi> eſtabliſhed by any other authority then that of the <hi>State,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> having called together ſome Eccleſiaſtical perſons, heard their advice, and by a <hi>Law</hi> eſtabliſhed ſome <hi>Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> to which no ſoul is otherwiſe obliged, then to a <hi>State-conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. That the Word of God hath left many things (not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be determined by it) to the Authority of the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> cannot be denied; whether any <hi>Ceremonies or no,</hi> is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119424:47"/>
a queſtion, diverſe <hi>circumſtances</hi> relating to the worſhip of God, are undoubtedly ſo left. Theſe are ſuch as relate to <hi>order</hi> and <hi>decency, i. e.</hi> without which the worſhip of God cannot be <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>decently</hi> performed, and do chiefly relate to <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> (the ordinary adjuncts of humane actions.) Thus we freely grant that the <hi>Civil power,</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> (orderly aſſembled) may determine, at what hours on the Lords day, the Congregation ſhall meet, as alſo it ſhall determine particular times for <hi>faſting</hi> or <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> as Gods providence ſhall adminiſter occaſions; that places of publique worſhip, ſhall be erected, frequented, kept decent, and an hundred things of that nature, which even reaſon and nature it ſelf teacheth all ſober perſons to be ſuch, as that without ſome order to be obſerved in them, the worſhip of God, either would not be performed, or would be undecently performed.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But that either any <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> ſhall be abſolute <hi>judges of order,</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> and that whatſoever of this nature ſhall be commanded by them, ſhall therefore be judged <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>orderly,</hi> becauſe they ſay ſo; and their commands ſhall oblige mens conſciences in things of this nature, where the word of God is ſilent, will want ſome proof before it be credited.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Or, that they <hi>have power,</hi> to command and <hi>impoſe ſuch things,</hi> under the notion of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> which have been groſly abuſed to <hi>idolatry and superſtition,</hi> or at which <hi>pious people</hi> have for a <hi>long time declared themſelves ſcandalized,</hi> or which have any <hi>remarkable appearance</hi> of <hi>evil in them</hi>; is ſo groſly falſe, that it needs no confutation, for they themſelves are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>To abſtain from all appearance of evil, to give no offence either to Jew or Gentile.</hi>

For when men by thoſe pompous Ceremonies departed from the pure ſimplicity of the primitive Church, they took no great care for holineſs of life, for the preaching of the Goſpel, for the comforts and efficacy of the holy Spirit, but they raiſed new contentions every day, about new Ceremonies added by ſeveral Popes, who thought none worthy of any great place, who did not bring in ſome new Ceremonious, (that I may not ſay) monſtrous, unheard of, and unuſual thing, and ſo they fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both Schools, and Pulpits with tales, and brablings: The

That the <hi>Surplis</hi> is made ſignificant of many things, for which we can ſee no ground at all; that all theſe have been ſtrenuouſly oppoſed, by as holy and learned men as any our Church hath bred: That the patern of all <hi>Synods</hi> Acts 15. thought fit to impoſe only ſome few <hi>neceſſary things</hi> for the ſtate of the Church at that time.

               <p>VVe vvould hope, that many of our Brethren, who are zealous for <hi>Liturgies,</hi> do believe, that the worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and hath been ſo ever ſince the practice of praying to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels; praying before Images</hi>; the <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>Croſſes</hi> and <hi>Relicks,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine of Tranſubstantiation</hi> came up amongſt them.

                  <q>God declares here (ſaith <hi>Zanchy</hi>) that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (having put all ſuperſtitions out of their Temples, yea out of their mouths and minds) ſhould be content with one God alone, and with his pure Word. And accordingly he teacheth us, that a true Reformation is not in thoſe places, nor a true Worſhip or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion there, where <hi>ANY</hi> Reliques of falſe Religion do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main: For all the Footſteps of Superſtition muſt be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, not only out of Churches, but out of our mouths and memories, that no door may be left open to former Idolatry: For the very <hi>remembrance of Falſe Worſhip,</hi> hath an influence upon men, to incite them to it again.

                  <note place="margin">Rivetus in Hoſ.</note>The Learned <hi>Rivet</hi> in his <hi>Corollaries from this Scripture,</hi> makes this for one; <q>That there are many Names which in themſelves are good enough, and might be uſed, but God abhorreth the uſe of them, becauſe they have been abuſed to Idolatry.</q> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in the word <hi>Maſs,</hi> applied to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, (to which may be added <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi>) Then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Hence we may judge, how prudently ſome of the <hi>Ancients</hi> did to uſe the names of <hi>Old Superſtition,</hi> in opening the <hi>Sacred Services</hi> of Chriſtians: whence aroſe another ſuperſtition, and the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Divine worſhip</hi> was vitiated.

But thirdly, God more expreſly forbad his people, <hi>any uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in his worſhip, which were uſed in idolatrous ſervices.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was that <hi>Precept, Exod.</hi> 20.26. and that v. 24. in which God forbad the people of Iſrael, to go up by <hi>ſteps unto his altar</hi>; or to make an altar of <hi>hewen Stone.</hi> Both (as <hi>Lyranus, Lippomannus,</hi> and many others agree,) <hi>That they might not be like idolaters</hi>; Thoſe filthy beaſts that worſhipped <hi>Priapus,</hi> were wont ſo to aſcend by ſteps.

               <p>The ſecond Text (yet more remarkable) is that <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.29, 30. &amp;c. <hi>When the Lord thy God ſhall cut off the Nations from before thee, whither thou goeſt to poſſeſs them; and thou ſucceedeſt them, and dwelleſt in their land, take heed to thy ſelf, that thou be not ſnared, by following them, after that they be deſtroyed before thee, and that thou enquire not after their Gods, ſaying, How did theſe nations ſerve their

               <p n="1">1. VVe cannot without ſome trembling weight thoſe many Scriptures, by which God hath ſecured both the <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>ſouls</hi> of our brethren from our injuries.

Nor to put a <hi>ſtumbling ſtone before the blind, Levit.</hi> 19.14. And as in reaſon the ſoul is more precious then the body, ſo the vviſe God hath proportionably forbidden us to do any things (in their own nature indifferent) by vvhich the ſouls of our brethren may be endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſinning againſt God.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The true notion of a ſcandalous action, (in the ſenſe we are now ſpeaking to it) is, <hi>Any action done by us (not being required by the divine Law) by which our brother, (whether from the nature and condition of the thing done, or the intention of him that doth it, or both) is made to ſin againſt God</hi>: It is true, there are a generation of men whom the doing of our duty will make to <hi>blaspheme</hi>; but our duty doth not <hi>ex conditione operis,</hi> lay any ſuch <hi>ſtumbling block</hi> before them.

               <p n="8">8. Whereas we are told that we <hi>offend many others,</hi> yea and thoſe our <hi>Superiors too,</hi> becauſe <hi>we do not do it.</hi> We anſwer we are not willing to <hi>offend</hi> any, much leſs our <hi>Superiours</hi>; but if we be brought to this ſtrait, <hi>that we must either offend God or Men</hi>; the choice is not difficult. We do humbly conceive, that by <hi>enticing,</hi> or by our example <hi>encouraging</hi> others to ſin, or by hardening any in ſinful opinions, or courſes, we ſhould highly offend God, we are told ſo by his word: God knows our hearts, it is a <hi>grievous Election</hi> to us, when we are by the Law of God forced to chuſe that part-in practice, which ſhall offend out <hi>Prince,</hi> or any <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> but our Souls are dear unto us; and in preſerving our own and others Souls, we hope our Gracious Soveraign will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>

When <hi>we lay a ſtumbling block before them, and make them ſin.</hi> We acknowledge it our duty to avoid the firſt, (if it may be) as to our meaneſt Brethren, much more to our Superiors. But if the caſe be ſtated thus, here is a thing required to be done; if you do not do it, <hi>the Magiſtrate will be offended through anger</hi>; if you do it, many private Chriſtians will be either <hi>hardned in ſin,</hi> or, <hi>tempted

to ſin</hi> by your example. VVhat have we to do in this caſe? but to beg of our Superiours to be <hi>merciful to us</hi>; if in this thing we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hearken to them, being ready in all lawful things to yield them utmoſt <hi>active obedience,</hi> and here alſo a quiet paſſive <hi>obedience.</hi> And that this is our caſe is evident to all that will not ſtop their ears, and ſhut their eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is true we do hear ſome whiſpering, that by this we lay alſo a <hi>ſtumbling block before our Fathers</hi> the <hi>Civil Magiſtrates,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> yea and many of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> who by our not uſing the ſaid <hi>Modes, and Forms of Worſhip,</hi> are ready to judge us <hi>diſloyal, diſobedient to Authority,</hi> and we tempt them to draw out the <hi>civil ſword againſt us,</hi> &amp;c. Now if indeed we do acknowledge <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and are (as we profeſs) ready to yield obedience, thoſe who otherwiſe judge of us, <hi>ſin againſt God</hi>; and thoſe who ſhall puniſh us as <hi>diſloyal</hi> (we being not ſo) alſo <hi>ſin againſt God.</hi> But by this <hi>non-conformity,</hi> they tell us, we give Superiors juſt cauſe ſo to cenſure us, and ſo to deal with us.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But to this objection the anſwer is not difficult, for we ſuppoſe that all ſober Divines are agreed in this principle, <hi>Si de veritate ſcandalum ſumatur, utilius naſci permittetur ſcandalum, quam quod veritas relinquatur</hi>; it was an old determination, no man ought to commit any thing againſt the precepts of God, for fear of making others ſin if he doth not commit it. Charity in this caſe certainly begins at home, we muſt not by <hi>ſin</hi> deſtroy our own ſouls, out of charity, to prevent the deſtruction of the <hi>work of God</hi> in the ſouls of others. <hi>Proximus ipſe ſibi.</hi> It is a good thing for us to keep our ſouls from ſin,<note place="margin">Bona res nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zant niſi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam mentem. <hi>Tert. de vel.

Whiles we judge the thing in it ſelf not lawful, cannot do it let who will be offended, and that will be granted by all; and vve have found ſome of our Brethren, who wiſh vve would do it, yet ſo ingenuous, as to beſeech us, not for their ſakes to <hi>wound our conſciences.</hi> But ſuppoſe we did think it in it ſelf and in all <hi>circumſtances indifferent,</hi> that we might, or might not do it, we profeſs we ſhould ſtill be at a loſs as the caſe ſtands, for theſe of our Brethren (whom we love and honour) how to gratifie them. We (ſuppoſe it) think the thing indifferent, it may be two or three or ten of our Brethren think it ſo too, and for <hi>uniformity</hi> deſire we would do it, poſſibly twenty, thirty, fourty others of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom vve ſee walking cloſe with God; they think it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vvith tears beſeech us not to do it. They are not <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſly</hi> offended, but they tell us, why they think it unlawful; <hi>They cannot bring their hearts up to be equally affected with a read prayer, as with one ſpoken from the immediate dictates of the heart: they cannot think it lawful</hi> for us to uſe <hi>Modes of worſhip,</hi> formerly <hi>uſed in an idolatrous ſervice</hi>; they cannot judge it lawful for the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to command any part (in a <hi>thing indifferent,</hi> in the vvorſhip of God) vvhich manifeſtly is <hi>ſcandalous</hi> to any <hi>conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of ſober Christians</hi>; they think the Law of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>ſcandalizing the weak,</hi> concerns <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> as vvell as others; and that it is of the ſame nature with any other <hi>Moral Law,</hi> not to be ſuperſeded by any <hi>humane power.</hi> VVhat ſhall we do in this caſe? Doubtleſs in all reaſon if it appear to us but <hi>indifferent,</hi> we are bound to abſtain by vertue of the command of God. And our Brethren, who would have us do the thing, (if they acknowledge the thing indifferent) muſt yield to their <hi>weaker Brethren,</hi> who are tied up from yielding to them, becauſe they think the thing <hi>unlawful.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.21.</note> or made <hi>weak.</hi> The matter for the omiſſion of which, the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> ſo ſeverely cenſureth us, is a thing in its own nature (at beſt) but <hi>indifferent</hi>; we plainly ſee, that ſhould we hearken to our <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> diverſe for whom (our conſciences tell us) Chriſt died, would be <hi>ſtumbled, offended,</hi> and made <hi>weak.</hi> VVe conceive, that the <hi>Law of Scandal</hi> concerns the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> as well as the <hi>Subject</hi>: And therefore ſuppoſing a command in that caſe (which
